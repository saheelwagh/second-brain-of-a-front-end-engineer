# What do you focus on, time or money ?
Common points between time and money :
1. Measurable -> develop a habit of tracking both
2. Scarce -> by tracking u already know wastage. Eliminate or minmise
3. Considered most valuable. Utilise both to maximise each other
4. We work to get them. And the activity to earb money consumes most of our time. Hence ensure that u can enjoy or at least not hate it.


We seem to constantly choose beween them. ideal life => not having to choose

Time is our most valyable resource and we fail to understand that.
