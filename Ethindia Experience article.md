With bags packed, bus tickets booked I was hammering at my laptop to install a toolkit to test a new tech at the hackathon. Failing so first innner dialouge shd u go?
past experiences 
Dinner table mom asked is there any use of going for hackathons ? And the spark that got ignited slwoly developed into a depressing smoke and flames of self doubt. 
When the alert flashed saying my bus was cancelled, it was a final hit on the nail. I did not have the energy to book another available bus. And got back to my work. 
Except nothing changed. Fell back to my malpractices. And at every setback i wondered if anything would have changed had I fought back against those adversities. 

fast forward to 3 months and I had made it to bangalore fighting off similar self doubts. This time to a grander event with 2000 participants. And yet in the 2000s only about a dozen of us were seated in a small room for a team formation session. We were the only people yet to find a team. The 4-5 of us who were still solo were made to occupy one row while 3-4 teams looking for addtions sat opposite to us and we had to describe our skills to fit in their teams. Speed datin shows looked easier than this, I thought to myself.

Among those teams was a group of 3 college students. They were there with an idea, unsure of how to go about it. But were there with a beleif that they will achieve something. 
I saw a 3 year back version of myself. WHo knew what he had to do something but did not  quite know how.
