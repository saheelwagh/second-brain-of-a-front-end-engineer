It is a great way to form a coding habit. Muscle memory is real and if you are a beginner then you should be practicing coding everyday, getting familiar both with the pl and the editor.

But easy to lose track of goals. Insert story of lost para in jungle.

Programming is not just about wrting code. Common tendency seen in new programmers.
They want to quickly start writing, or worst, copying the starter code.  It is important to first separate whqat you know from dont know. And most importantoly where you want to go. 

Easy to get distracted from the path by lesser peaks (this can be a draft) such as a new library or lang and end up drifitng further from your goal.

Once you start coding, you arte bound to get get stuck somewhere (thick cover) or you are not growing. This will lead you to get further lost if you are not clrar where to go.

Once yu start tracking your code time, it can be easy to fallzcy of just increasing time while still not making substantial progress and ending up tired, with eyes having been hit with a toll. 

So how to strike the balance :

keep 80-20 goal
fill up 80% with some sort of tutorial that aligns with your long term knowledge portfolio goals. 
keep 20% for work tasks

dedicate the rest of the time to getting better about thinking of code.
