Programmers , coders (makers ) perfer to use time in units of at least half a day. 

An hour is barely enough to get started. Not a big enough time to make a good essay or module

Stuff like meetings that breaks this unit into two wrecks the schedule.

if I know i will get diracted then I might not even start ?

Paul graham used to code from dinner till 3 am. then wake up around 11 and work on the business stuff 
( can I copy this for 10am ) ?
