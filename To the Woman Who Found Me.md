To the woman who found me at my lowest
You said it was your lowest
You were sent to teach me true joy
When i had no clue how to enjoy
You were sent to teach me pain
As I now realise you'll never love me again
Your intense gaze pierced my soul
Holding you tight, I felt whole
Now youre gone
Not away but not close enough
I'm stuck in a limbo whether I was enough
I'll find peace in the lessons learned
Hearts broken and love earned
You'll always live in my thoughts reminding me
The perfection whose man I couldn't be
I'll only find you in others 
through bits and pieces
Agonizing every night that 
I never showered you with kisses
For you only deserved the highest form of love
I was incapable so I had to move
I hope you find the man who loves you
In all ways the able me would
To the woman who found me
Much before I could
