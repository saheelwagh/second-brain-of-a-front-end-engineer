- debugging
	- The more problems you solve ,faster to promo to senior . within one year is possible. The shortest I have seen is 5 months.
- commitment and proactiveness
	- When you see some s**t code, instead of “walk away” (or s**t on top of that s**t!), clean it up, as a pro.
	- Once done, don’t wait, ask your senior this question : “what can I help next” ?if want to be visible, be proactive and do this often .
	- All the task or bugs assigned to you given days normally could be finished by a senior dev in hours. these problems are not only for you to learn, also a chance to show your quality to everyone.
- **know when to code**
	- Before coding. make sure you understand the requirement well ,what you are going to implemented is confirmed with product owner(manager) ;explain to yourself first what you are going to do, draft all the “if-else” sudo code in mind ,if you see some edge cases, scalibility issue , security issue, race condition or any performance questions in mind, make sure all these discussed with your senior or lead .
	- Make sure you know how to test , what features will be affected, so you need know all the modules has to be tested .
