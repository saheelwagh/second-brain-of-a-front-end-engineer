- Why senior devs get nothing done
  collapsed:: true
	- start of job -> sheer amnt of thins to learn was overwhelming, cal is free
	- a good manager will put you on one long project. It is the best way to learn
	- senior devs -> schedule punctured with ultiple responsibilties
		- to fix
			- utilise timeboxing
			- optimize (re read)
				- mental tools are like duster. could not find, so had to look for else. better to file in easy to retrieve way
				- when q -> solved. document it and share
				- reuse libs and templates
				-
- so how do you become a senior engineer ?
  collapsed:: true
	- own the process
		- be the PM u want to see in the world
		- ask many questions until you are sure you understand both the spec and its spirit
	- certainty makes thew difference
		- u gon be done tom ? -> no, here's why

- Your career needs a vision
  collapsed:: true
	- The Art of Science and Engineering, Richard Hamming says the key to a great career is vision.
		- even a small push or pull of 10% can make a huge diff
	- working in your careeer vs on it
		- If you want to improve your career a lot, you have to work on your career. You
		  have to do work that force multiplies yourself, not just those around you.
		- You can become a better engineer specialist through pet projects. Explore some
		  new tech, develop some new skills. Watch talks, read blogs, go to conferences.
		  Learn more skills.
		- Next time somebody needs a thing, you can say, “I can do that!”.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666961984658_0.png)
		- An easier way at the beginning, and harder when your projects take off, is to
		  work on open source. It’s a lot like giving talks, but easier to ﬁt in your schedule.
		  Until you’re famous. Then it’s harder.
		- You can be a connector. Go out and meet people. Introduce people to each other.
		  Make people comfortable in social situations. Connect person who needs X with
		  a person who knows X
			- An engineer who is good at social is a rare breed. Your career will skyrocket.
			  This is how you become a VP of Engineering. You think they code? No, they
			  deal with people
			- **The connector approach works best if you ever want to start your own team. Oh,you need 5 engineers with skills in X, Y, and Z? Yeah, I know them. I’m buddies
			  with 10 of them. I’ll have a team put together in 2 weeks**

	- The mindset shift I urge you to consider is this: It doesn’t matter how hard or
	  how much you work, it only matters how much value they get.
	- Tell your friends how much you make. Figure out together how you all can make
	  more.
	- Just a $2000 salary increase can compound into $178,000 of lifetime savings
	  and that’s kinda crazy
	- should you work at startup ?
		- If you can get paid really well, have stable income, work on problems you enjoy
		  solving, and work in nice offices with free lunch ... why would you resist? Go be
		  a normie.
		- br an employee with the mindset of a freelancer
