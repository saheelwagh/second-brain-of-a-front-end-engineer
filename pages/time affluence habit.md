- Even  when  know  we  should  make  time-centric  decisions,  escaping  the allure of money is remarkably difficul
- In  fact,  these  so-called  Taylors  made time-centric decisions only about 5percent of the time.
- Let me reiterate: research clearly shows that people who value time are  happier,  healthier,  and  more  productive  than  those  who  value  money over time.2 But we still focus on money, because we underesti-mate the value of our time; we tell ourselves that we will have more time tomorrow than we do right now (we won’t
- Anyone  who  wants  to  lose  weight  will  tell  you  about  that  struggle.  Sugar  is  bad  but  alluring.  Exercise  is  good  but  hard  to  instigate.  We  know we should work out, but we could just relax; after all, we’re tired and  the  gym  is  pretty  far  away.  Parts  of  our  brain  drive  us  to  choose  vice over virtue. Messages bombard us telling us to do the wrong thing. It’s not easy.
	- And  it’s  the  same  with  time  and  money.  To  our  minds,  money  is  a  need that takes over our attention. In contrast, time is a currency that’s hard to grasp and easily ignored.
- Some  researchers  have  gone  so  far  as  to  call  money  a  drug,  because its physical effects are similar to those produced by natural and chemical substances in our bloodstream.

	- All of us have our own personal Candy Crush behavior, an activ-ity we compulsively, somewhat thoughtlessly engage in
	- But  when  “now  and  again”  becomes  a  habit,  the  activity  becomes  an  unhealthy  time  suck,  discon-necting us from human connection or from better, more time-affluent activities.15

	- clock time person vs event time person
		- defined by hours vs by event
		- One approach to time affluence isn’t better than the other; the better system is the one that matches your mindset. In either case, you need to follow through on your best-laid plans, whether those plans are set by the clock or by the event. Know who you are, and start planning (or roughly sketching out) your approach.
- create intentions
  collapsed:: true
	- Intentions become powerful when we tie them to daily actions that take our time away.

		- For example, if you want to enjoy more books, you might state your intention as listen to books on tape. But an even better one  would  be  to  use  my  commute  to  listen  to  books  on  tape.  In  this  way,  you’ve found time and replaced the time-impoverishing activity with an intention for a time-affluent activity

  collapsed:: true
	- extreme case of this, a new initiative—the four-day workweek—rewards employees with Fridays off if they complete their work between Monday and  Thursday.
	- It’s better to choose uncertain or surprising rewards. One way to do this is to let a friend give you the reward; it could even be a dinner together (thereby adding to your good use of time!).
	- Give yourself a 50-50 chance of winning either one fancy coffee or two by flipping a coin. Research sug-gests that building in a bit of uncertainty about winning smaller versus larger prizes can boost personal commitment

- recognize and fight mere urgency
  collapsed:: true
	- Sometimes when we are procrastinating on harder, more important ac-tivities, such as preparing for an interview, we will waste our time with simpler, less important activities, such as answering email.
	- we default to thinking about whether or not a task is urgent, as opposed to whether or not it is important.

		- map to it regularly

	- You may also recognize patterns. Do you take on merely urgent ac-tivities  around  a  deadline,  for  example,  as  an  avoidance  mechanism?  Do  you  succumb  to  mere  urgency  when  you’re  tired?  Is  there  one  person  constantly  asking  you  for  favors  that  are  urgent  to  them  but  aren’t important to you?
	- schedule proactive time into your life
	  collapsed:: true
		- time reserved for important but not urgent work (or lei-sure), found in the upper left of the matrix
		- It’s  the  important  activities  that  we  defer  when  mere  urgency  sur-faces  (clean  up  résumé;  write  a  project  proposal;  call  mother).  Clock-time types can set aside an hour for pro-time. Event-timers can plan to do it at some predictable part of the day, such as late afternoon.
		- Map  some  of  your  upcoming  priorities  on  the  matrix.  For  work,  these are things you must do. For your personal life, it’s more likely to be things you want to do. Then schedule pro-time into each day for the next couple of weeks, and assign tasks to those time blocks
		- Pro-time should be distraction free: this is critical. The merely urgent crops up in communication that interrupts the important things you’re doing. So during your daily pro-time, turn off all distractions and block off your calendar so that the merchants of urgency can’t spring surprise de-mands on you. Stay focused on important tasks during this block of time
		- In  a  recent study we conducted with a group of computer engineers, employ-ees  who  were  randomly  assigned  to  schedule  pro-time  for  themselves  felt they had greater control over their time and felt they were better at time  management.  They  felt  less  stressed.  They  reported  being  more  productive. Importantly for their organizations, they felt happier about their jobs overall. Of those assigned to schedule pro-time, 84percent said the method should be used across their entire organization.

- make leisure time leisurely
	- You may have had a similar experience. It’s not uncommon. Research-ers find that thinking about the economic value of our leisure time can undermine  our  enjoyment  of  it,  because  we  are  constantly  comparing  the experience against some perceived expected value or ideal.36 This has been shown in many types of activities: when we track the distance of a morning nature walk, we enjoy the scenery less. When we track the number of calories we’re burning during a run, we don’t derive as much joy from the experience as we do if we’re running to feel good.
	- In short, do not think about how much the vacation cost or whether the  house  cleaner  was  worth  the  financial  investment.  Instead,  think  about how nice it is to spend extra time with your friends and family—or curled up on the futon enjoying a movie with your significant other.
