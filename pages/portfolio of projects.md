	- Managing the entire project portfolio is easy when senior management
	  has a strategic plan and manages to that plan. It’s not too difficult, if the
	  middle managers understand how to think strategically and tactically
	  even if your senior management isn’t so good at strategic planning.
	- Managing the project portfolio is difficult if you’re the only one doing it,
	  no matter what level you are. If you’re a first-line manager or a technical
	  lead, you may feel as if you’re pushing a boulder uphill.
	- As long as you finish work in chunks so other people can see it and use
	  it, you will be successful.
	- Start with your work, and then work with others. This requires courage,
	  but if you’ve made it this far, you have plenty.

	- Your customers want your products to be filled with great features that
	  are well-tested and run smoothly. They don’t care about your projects,
	  and they certainly don’t care about your portfolio. Your customers care
	  about your products.
	- Keep that in mind as you work with your project portfolio. The portfolio
	  is not an end—it’s a means. Think of your portfolio as a pipeline of
	  potential work.
	- In a
	  way, that’s like saying I’ll introduce you to your appointment calendar.
	  You don’t value an appointment calendar or a project portfolio until you
	  start using it to shape your days, weeks, and months. That’s the job of
	  the rest of the book.
	- The portfolio is an organization of projects, by date and value, that the
	  organization commits to or is planning to commit to. In a sense, the
	  portfolio is a Big Visible Chart.
		- it helps to decide
			- • When to commit to a project so a product development team can
			  start or continue a project.
			  • When it’s time to end a project and free a team for other work.
			  • When to transform a project and commit to the changed project.
			  • And, when it’s difficult to decide between projects, the portfolio
			  provides a visual tool that helps you negotiate which project to do
			  when.
