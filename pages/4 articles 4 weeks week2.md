- Last month I had a great time visiting web3conf India
- I went  there in search of inspiration around web3 ecosystem
- I am personally not attracted to projects that have a high participation of people. Less voting more coding is my jam
- There were stalls put up by many web3 companies. The one that caught my eye was stackos https://www.home.stackos.io/
- what is stockos ?
- ok what is the big deal in decentralised hosting ?
- how aws started
- current state of market
- imagine scenario where aws goes down or rogue ?
- giving hosting back to the masses
