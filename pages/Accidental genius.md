			- I’d be exploring my assigned topic through freewriting and, following the dictates of the technique, I’d digress. Often, my digressions concerned my day job and the problems I experienced as a sales director for a book wholesaler. While I was supposed to be writing a review of a TV show, I’d wander and write about a prospect my company was trying to win. While I was doing a profile on a punk rocker, I’d veer toward ways of coaching a troublesome employee.
			- n the end, I’d finish my article, but I also frequently came away with answers to my problems in the rest of my life. Accidentally, I was acting as my own consultant.
