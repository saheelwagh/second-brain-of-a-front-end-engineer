- praise
  collapsed:: true
	- the next prag prog
	- code that devs can live by
	-
- who is the 21st century programmer ?
	- noncredited everything and rtedfefimed everyday
- Metaphor
	- how we make sense of what we do by equating with more matured industries
	- follow meta with care
	- plan enough, then build
	  collapsed:: true
		- the plan (artchitect) metaphor overvalues the time we spend trying to perfect everything
		- In traditionalarchitecture,planningis essential.Certainthings unequivocally have to happen before others. Studsgoinbeforeplumbing.Plumbingisinstalledbeforethewalls.Thewallshavetobetherebeforethepaint.Undo,Cut,orRevertaren’tviableoptionswhenbuildingaskyscraper

		- Withouttheluxuryoftheseverysimpleyetpowerfulges-tures, buildingsrequire very detailed specifications.Onefootshortisthedifferencebetweenaprofitablepieceofrealestateandacatastrophicfront-pageheadline.
		- insert twin tower gif here
		- these are the luxuries we are afforded
		- insert indian mom analogy of fear of breaking things
		-
		-
	- keep coding, it is where you are the most valuable
	- diversification over specialization
		- many concepts transcend langauges
			- mvc
			- design patterns
		- All too often I hear a programmerinstantlydenounceeventhepossibilitythatshecouldalsobeagreatvisual designer. Conceptually, designinguser interfacesisnot that far off the map from designinga sound softwarearchitecture.Great, functionalUIs are about clear affor-dances, organization,scalability, and intention.They havemanyofthesamequalitieswecherishinsoftwaredesign.
		- The reverse is also true. Too few talenteduser interfacedesignersconsiderthemselves capable of becominggreatprogrammers.Perhapsprogrammerslookatuserinterfacedesign as making things “pretty”and designerslook atprogrammingas writing a lot of “technicalstuff.” Mean-while,theyhavesomuchmoreincommonthanthat.
		- my thoughts as a freelance developer
	- better metaphors
		- SIMIlarities with writing a novel
			- an author outlines a chapter to get gen guise to write avt
			- then write then edit
			-
- programmer motivation
  collapsed:: true
	- unmotivated devs kill software projects
		- the perks are in the work
		- choose a company where
		  collapsed:: true
			- more impassioned employees
			- more interesting problems
		- begin where where you love to begin
			- Sometimesthehardestplacetofindmotivationisattheverystart.Thinkingaboutcodeiseasy.Softwarealwayscompilesperfectlyinourheads.Wedon’tobsessoverthehundredsof minor obstacleswe’ll face along the way. But once wecommit to actually writing code, the entire game changes.Motivationcanfadequickly.
			- the experience of  writing software is not too different from writing a book
			  collapsed:: true
				- spent more time abt what want to write than actually writing
				- soul sucking game of unispired lines, mental blocks and fatigue
				- Natalie Goldberg’s [[Writing Down the Bones]] [ Gol05]  is an entire book on motivation for writers.
				  collapsed:: true
					- instead of focusing on the big opening, start writing somewhere in the middle of the story.
					- Begin at the most imp point right now
					-
				- similarly ,we dont have to start with the home page before the subpages or with the database before the business logic
					- we can always refactor later
					  collapsed:: true
						- how can this be used in article to differentiate from tradi building ?
						-
					- How to use this in software planning ?
						- while building big software
							- rather than spending 3 days formulating a timeline and release schedulem commit those days to work on part of app uf find most interesrting. In a week u will know when other parts can fall into place
							- 3 days of solid work helps generate a realistic timeline
							-
						-
			- put together a timeline realistic only after having a bit of inspired work under your belt
			-
		- Be Imperfect
		- stop programming
			- 2 hours of quality prog is better than 8 hours of struggle
			-
		- test your work the first thing in the morning
			- day -> steam lost for testing
			- fatigue makes miss details
			- on waking up, mental cobwebs are gone. thus best time to review the big picture
			-
			- wjen testing retrace the flow again
		- work outside the bedroom
			-
- programmer productivity
	- just say no to pet projects
	  collapsed:: true
		- pet projects  fails when therew are no time constaints and nothing is on the line if we do not succeed
			- limit how much time will spend on working each day on the project and how many days per week
			-
	- constrain all your parameters
		- when we have no walls around us we lose sight of reality
		- every step shd take towards building a more succesful software, There are not enough resources to do asnything else
	- cut the detail out of the timeline
		- build deliverables in sizable chucks not in small breadcrumbs
		- for an eight week project prefer eight weekly deliverables over eight daily ones
			- work in product cycles instead of each screen
	- Improve product in 2 ways daily
	  collapsed:: true
		- programming sucks so sustainable productivity has to come from tiny victories
		- tied to kaizen
			- in a week -> 10 better things to say about product and in a month 40
		-
		-
	- invest in a good work env
	  collapsed:: true
		- invest in screen real estate
	- keep a personal todo list
	  collapsed:: true
		- what it NOT
		  collapsed:: true
			- project timeline
			- gantt chart
				- those are too sweeping for a single person
				- better off for big pic
		- shd be adjustable
		- shd not care about the past
		- utilise buckets
		- daily based
		- action item
		-
		-
		-
		-
- pride
  collapsed:: true
	- construt work -> law trouble at some stage
	- when really into coding
	  collapsed:: true
		- live inside our heads far more than most
		- stare at screen in typing trance
		- simply want to be left alone
		-
	- the detail is where the appeal is
		- accesible -> prog version of 30 min dishes and $5 dishes ?
		- vlog on dev process ?
		-
- code
  collapsed:: true
	- [[Write Code as a last resort]]
	- [[code is the ultimate junior developer]]
	- plug in happy future of code
		- frameworks
		- nocode
		- invest money where needed
		- when do you roll out your own tool (plugin extension or framework?)
			- an intimate und of problem space
			-
- [[Handling clients]]
- teaching code
  collapsed:: true
	- teaching is unlike coding
	- beware the curse of coding
		- While it’s  unfortunately promoted in  our  society to  be  reasonable andsensible, these characteristics will not serve you in sales or in life
		- use feynmans
	- teach with obvious examples
		- devoid of abstractions
		-
- clients
  collapsed:: true
	- software minus clients => hobby
	- demystify the black magic of software
		- prog -> organize=s of logic and data
			- pushing, pulling, manipulating and displaying data
		- Showthemwhatyou’vebeenworkingon.Stepthemthroughtheactualcodeifyoumust.Get them involved in thinkingthrough the questionsthatnaturallycome up to you when you’re in the midst ofprogramming.
	- define the goals of the app
	- be enthusiastic and opinionated
		- Programming is as much art as it is science
		- offerthemthosesameoptionswithastrongconvictiontowardone.Thenexplainwhy.
