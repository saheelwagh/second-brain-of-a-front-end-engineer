- Based on Paretto principle -> focus on the 20%.
- think skill wise  => application >> stack
- design
  collapsed:: true
	- as a beginner, this is the approach to follow as a designer :
	  collapsed:: true
		- first learn the [[design fundamentals]]
		- practice them
		- then add your own twist
		-
	- is a mental skill, not a tool
	- grid based layouts
	  collapsed:: true
		- based on the principle of alignment. -> messy room vs clean room -> chaos vs order
		  collapsed:: true
			- how relates to attention space and working memory ?
		- reuse values as much as possible
		- repeated layout => prediction => trust

	- optical illusions
	  collapsed:: true
		- object of the same dimension can be made to look smaller or bigger by adjusting its
		  collapsed:: true
			- weight
			- proximity
			-
		- floating centered text vs sinking -> floating looks more natural -> allocate accordingly
		  collapsed:: true
			- heavier objects will look more natural when sinking
			-
	- Rule of proximity
	  collapsed:: true
		- related objects should be grouped together
		- a common example of this is grouping navigation links together away from the brand logo
		-
	- colors
	  collapsed:: true
		- always sample colors. Best way to choose is to borrow. Best place to borrow is mother nature.

- how to design learning time
  collapsed:: true
	- decide the mode of learning to be used
	  collapsed:: true
		- books
			- [[Modern Css with Tailwind]]
			-
	- design env accordingly
		- books => download req's and then offline
		- video course => material, editor and note taking ready, time blocks

- think in terms of immersive tasks -> need my presence vs process tasks -> need me to start or maintain and then hand off
  collapsed:: true
	- prioritize immersive tasks first
- develop a finishing mindset
  collapsed:: true
	- ((6285ebee-b1b8-4c98-a0ce-f73ec7923adf))
		- How and when will I finish this?
		- about staying focused on the final deliverable and constantly tracking toward the expectations of the people you will be delivering to.
		- Itâ€™s about making a plan not just for starting things, but for ending things. In the same way a pilot has a plan not only for taking off, but for landing.

- mastering tools  and frameworks (procedures)
  collapsed:: true
	- master small precise movements -> high speed assembly line of habits. The speed comes from the accumulated efficiency in every step in their workflow.
	- master code reading with the same approach
	-
- physical space -> cues and stickys
  collapsed:: true
	- if remote worker -> create a sense of predictability
	-
- Work in weekly sprints and only then assign daily (flexible tasks)
  collapsed:: true
	- planning -> continual learning from feedback
	- day by day emergy -> can be reallocated later
