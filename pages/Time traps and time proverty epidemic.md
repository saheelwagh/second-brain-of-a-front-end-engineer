- [[Time Smart]] ch 1
- it really is that bad. In 2012, about 50percent of working Americans reported they were “always rushed,” and 70percent “never” had enough time.3 In 2015, more than 80percent said they didn’t have the time they needed.4 That’s how I guessed you were time poor. You’ve said so.
- People who are time poor are less happy, less productive, and more stressed-out.6 They exercise less, eat fattier food, and have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease.
- Trying to maximize our time to get things done makes our workdays a sedentary blur of salt, fat, and fast food.
- Unhappy employees waste $450 billion−$550 billion in lost productivity each year.
- The  effects  and  costs  of  time  poverty  are  so  stark  that  researchers  now compare it to a famine
- why are we time poor ?

	- The most obvious explanation for rising rates of time poverty is that we simply spend more time working than we used to.
		- But evidence doesn’t support this theory. Believe it or not, **most people have more time for leisure  now**  than  in  the  1950s.12  In  1950,  OECD  data  show  that  the  average workweek in the United States was 37.8 hours; in 2017 it was 34.2.  Time  diaries  show  that  in  the  United  States,  men’s  leisure  time  has increased six to nine hours per week in the past fifty years, and women’s has increased four to eight hours
		- Technology—microwaves and vacuum robots, digital communication and that snazzy feature on my email app that auto-suggests meeting times (the best!)—helps us live more-efficient  lives.  With  the  rise  of  the  sharing  economy,  companies  like Uber and TaskRabbit also make time-saving services more acces-sible and affordable.14
		- Why, then, do we feel more time poor than ever?
	- It’s because time poverty doesn’t necessarily arise from a mismatch between the hours we have and the hours we need. **It results from how we think about and value those hours.**
		- s much psychological as it is structural.  We  might  not  be  working  more  hours,  but  we  are  making  decisions to work at all hours.
		- ’s easy to  continuously  pay  attention  to  that  which  we  believe  will  make  us  more  money.  Valuable  free  time  arrives;  we  are  unprepared  to  use  it  and so we waste it. Or we tell ourselves we shouldn’t take a break, so we work through it.
	- It’s not our fault we’ve ended up like this. Culturally, the inherent value  of  time  has  been  suppressed.  Society  teaches  us  that  we  should  hero-worship  people  who  never  leave  the  office.17  Moreover,  rising  income inequality makes us feel as if our world could collapse tomor-row if we don’t spend every moment working, or at least appearing to work.18These factors create what I call time traps, which lead most of us to feel chronically time poor. -> problems with productivity advice
	- The  first  step  to  becoming  time  smart  is  to  understand  these  [[time  traps]] and identify them in your life.

	- Thinking about your life overall, how much spare time do you have? Use a scale of −5 to 5, where −5 is very little or no spare time, and 5 is lots of spare time
	- Thinking about your life overall, how much spare money do you have? Use a scale of −5 to 5, where −5 is very little or no spare money, and 5 is lots of spare money
	- plot on grid
	- evaluate yourself
		- In  the  table  below,  document  which  time  traps  affect  you  most,  and  describe the specific decisions that you make in each category. For exam-ple, in the technology time trap, you might write, “Spend too much time researching small purchases.”
			- tech (checking texts, emails, and other notifications; using websites to research decisions, etc.)
			- Work obsession (focusing on earning more money in hopes you’ll reach a point where you’re satisfied, and it will free up time then)
			- Undervalued time (choosing the cheapest price no matter how much time it costs)
			- Busyness as status (appearing to be working at all times and tying self-worth to work)
			- The Yes . . . damn! effect (committing to too many future activities because it seems you’ll have more time in the future)
