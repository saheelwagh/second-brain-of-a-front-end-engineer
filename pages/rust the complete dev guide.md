- How can generalists niche down ?
  collapsed:: true
	- If you’re a generalist, one of the things you enjoy in life is learning, thinking, and discovering new things. You’re constantly on a quest to understand how the world works. You love jotting things down, taking notes, and playing with ideas. This is the joy of curiosity at its peak.
	- But on the flip side, boredom is never far. Once you find what you’ve been looking for, you don’t feel excited about “digging” deeper
	- Become a selfish altruist
		- If you want it or not, people will put you in a specific box. So the best thing you could do for your marketing is to give them the box you want them to put you in.
		- Picking your niche is a cross point between your interests and what the market is willing to pay for. (Sounds barbarian, but yes… if you want to make a living out of your work, you need to embrace the business side of things, too.)
		- Variable number 1: Embracing your curiosity. People like us have a strong need for meaning and self-accomplishment. Strip that away, and you’re on a highway to living a nightmare. In order to get this part of the equation right, you need to be selfish. Listen to yourself. Listen to what you enjoy.
		- Variable Number 2: Understanding the market. You can only have a business and make a living as a writer if there’s a market for what you have to say. In other terms, you have to be altruist enough to learn what problems your general knowledge can solve.
