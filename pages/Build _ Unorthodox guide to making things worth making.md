			- Look around and find the community of people who are passionate about it, too. If there’s nobody else on Earth thinking about it, then you may truly be too early or going in the wrong direction. But if you can find even a handful of like-minded people, even if it’s just a tiny community of geeks building technology nobody has any idea how to turn into a real business, then keep going

		- Think of a project as a straight line in time—there’s a beginning and (hopefully) an end. Everyone is walking at the same pace, day by day, on parallel lines—a line for engineering, marketing, sales, PR, customer support, manufacturing, legal, etc.

			- The details of the project right in front of you are crystal clear, but the farther you look out, the fuzzier everything becomes. And different teammates are gazing at different points on that timeline.
		- Your job isn’t just doing your job. It’s also to think like your manager or CEO. You need to understand the ultimate goal, even if it’s so far away that you’re not really sure what it’ll look like when you get there.
