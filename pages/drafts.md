	- beach intro
		- Watching movie, netflix and chill, cafe, these are some of people favorite date activities. Mine's sunset. There's a unique comfort in seeing a day pass by and knowing that end of the day you are not alone. On other ocassions the computer's blue light takes this pain away by taking away all sensations. So on this particualr ocassion, we saw the sun set. attention finally went to the date. The fading lights made her skin glow nicely. all internal voices screaming 'kiss her'
		- i took out my little pocket notebook and listed out the pros and cons of escalating things with her.the answer was yes but by then she had excused herself and left.
		- some of it is imaginary. up to you to decide how much

	- scheduling incubation
	- The optimistic punisher
		- someone who tortures you with the best intentions. When I planned anything, I was expecting a quick reward either for myself or clients. So i used to expect too much out of my own ability.
		  If I have a task that takes a week, say building [this](site) , I planned to build it in a day.
		  Theoretically, this meant I got free from its responsibilities, and the next days would be free for anything. Extending, I front loaded tasks for first half of week, keeping the second free for anything
		  Practically this meant I was constantly stressed, lashed out at tiniest of things, crammed everything into unreasonable estimates and produced sub par work.

	- how to schedule week for creative break throughs ?
		- schedule your upcoming breaks
			- if you are young enough, you will get to carve these out
			- if you are old, these might be responsinilities, quad 1 or 3 tasks or family functions. SOmething that does not require you to focus like at work
		- list out all work and creative tasks and frame them as questions to answer
			- helps to see everything in one hub.
			- also helps in prioritization
		- is there any problem that can be solved in one shot or one time block ? schedule it in one of your deep work hours
		- any problem that needs to be broken down and staging ?
			- separate parts that will reveal answers or get more clarity on the next phase
		- execute on these till your next break with full laser focus
		- when breaking, enjoy fully, carry a small notebook to note any insights that hit
		- insights will hit naturally. or if they don't u will have solved the essentials at least\
