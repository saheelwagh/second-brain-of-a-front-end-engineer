- React Router is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React
- BrowserRouter -> connect app to browser's url
	- render it around your whole app
	- cd
- Link -> global nav
	- cahnges the url without causing a full page reload
- Routes -> wraps around each route
- Nested and persistent routes

	- Repeating shared layouts is a pain in the neck.
	- We've learned that most UI is a series of nested layouts that almost always map to segments of the URL so this idea is baked right in to React Router.
	- two steps to het pesrsitent layout
		- nest the routes
		- render an outlet
	- this will nest the url and nest the ui components (for 2nd u need outlet)
	- Now click around again. The parent route (App.js) persists while the <Outlet> swaps between the two child routes (<Invoices> and <Expenses>)!

	- Money is a universal, circular asset in the world. And you too can become financially independent, if you choose to adopt a few wealth-growing practices and change your current mindset
	- At first, you’ll have to acknowledge your financial situation. Biased financial decisions are what stand in the way between your current life and the life you desire.
	- Being greedy can turn out to be the biggest financial mistake you’ll ever make.
	  Envy has no place in the money market, as it can blur your thinking. 
	  Our early experiences with money determine our financial decisions later on.

	- Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.
	- The most precious resource you have is your own time and energy, and when you spend it on your team, it goes a long way toward building healthy relationships. This is why one-on-one meetings (“1:1s” for short) are such an important part of management. I recommend no less than a weekly 1:1 with every report for thirty minutes, and more time if needed.
