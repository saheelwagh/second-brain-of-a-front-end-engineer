	- Progressive summarization speeds up capture and review
	- while capturing gather the main points as you skim
	- second pass (shallow task), bold and headline the structure
	- third (deep) hand typed summary
- action items and links
	- LATER write an article of progressive summarization walking through a code feature
	-

  collapsed:: true
	- ayer 1 -> **excerpts**
	- denoting the structure
	- still not easily skimmable
- layer 2 -> **bold the important points**
	- introduce heirarchy
	- could qualify as a shallow task
- layer 3 -> **summary**
	- while writing this think about reusability. Where can this info be plugged in ?
