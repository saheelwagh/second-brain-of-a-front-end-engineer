- There is something I do daily but also dont do daily
- When i dont do it, I get restless and spread it elsewhere
- Firm believer with things like openai that high level thinking is the most important task
- feel like something is missing from my days
- there is also the thing that i find it rare to be understood. When i write, at least I understand myself
- writing gets me into the elusive flow state
- which then sets me up for creative work
- asymmetrical creativity -> flow state and non flow state
- if i hv to progress, i hv to be more in flow -> i hv to write
- and that is why i write
- case in point, plans
- career plans
- time
- because if I dont build my life around writing, my life  will gets reduced to nothing but writing
