	- why
		- start by designign for pennies or free
		- To be precise, I even had -$4000 in my bank account
		  when I got my first client and had to sell half of my equipment to
		  keep my “business” going. And it was the best decision ever.
		- See, the good thing is, once you get past that first obstacle and
		  reach a healthy cashflow, there are no boundaries when it comes to
		  freelance work, literally.
		- What they do is they outsource the client-facing work to project
		  managers and sales reps and just focus on the fun part - designing
		  websites and posting their results online. And these results gain
		  momentum and bring enormous exposure after a while.
		- They know one important thing, once your snowball starts
		  rolling, you’re unstoppable.
		- Personally, it took me close to 3 years to get my own snowball rolling
		  because I had to figure everything out myself

- Project Prep
	- calendly
		- If you have the freedom to choose your clients and you’re a busy
		  individual, you might send a quick intro message to inform them
		  what working with you looks like, and what’s your minimum fee when
		  starting a new project, etc.
		- My minimum engagement fee is $5000. I can invest 40-80 hours
		  per month on an additional project. I track every hour through
		  Clockify and send weekly reports for your review.”
		- I communicate through Slack or a platform of your choice. I’m
		  familiar with project management tools like Trello, Notion, Jira,
		  Asana, and Monday.
