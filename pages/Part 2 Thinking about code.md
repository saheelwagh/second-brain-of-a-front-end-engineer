- reaching a deeper understanding of code ch 5
  collapsed:: true
	-
- r**oles of variable** framework
  collapsed:: true
	- vars play a central role in thinkign qaobut code
	- as per prof jorma Snananiemi the reason vars are hard to und is that most programmers do not have a good schema in their ltm to relate variables to.
	  collapsed:: true
		- we need some intermediat schmea b/w  chunks too desne , such as var oor int and something too  light like num_of_custs
		-
	- diff vars do diff things
	  collapsed:: true
		- 11 roles to cover almost all vars
			- 1. Fixed val -> const such as pi, data read from file or db
			  2. stepper -> variable stepping through a list of values while iterating through a loop
			  3. flag -> to ind something has happened or is the case
			  4. walker -> traverses a ds in a way that is unknown before
			  5. most recent holder -> latest val encountered in goign through a serire of values ex latest in file.readline() or el = list[i]
			  6. most wanted holder -> what val is being searched for or the best fit like min and max values
			  7. gatherer 
			  8. container -> holds els that can be added and removed. lists, stack etc 
			  9. follower
			  10. organizer -> 
			  11. temp
			- variable table cols
				- 1. var name
				  2. type
				  3. ops
				  4. role
				- LATER ts types and relation to roles philosophy . How it differes from normal js
	- hungarian notation of vars
	  collapsed:: true
		- encode type of var into its name
		-
- gaining a deeper knowledge of prgrams
	- 2 diff levels at which programmer can understand code -> text structure knowledge and plan knowledge
		- surface level (what is ) vs deeper why this
	- diff stages of prog und
		- 1. focal point of ref or entry or loc of error
		  2. expand knowledge using breakpoints et al
		  3. und a concept from set of related entities 
		  4. und of coenpts across entities
		- method
			- 1. circle focal point
			  2. cicrle all related entities
			  3.
