	- Rather than earning a little interest, like most people do in their savingsaccounts, you can earn around 8 percent per year over the long term byinvesting: Over the twentieth century, the average annual stock market returnwas 11 percent, minus 3 percent for inflation, giving us 8 percent. To put thatin perspective, let’s assume that you have $1,000 at age 35 to put somewhere.Let’s also assume that your savings account returns 3 percent on average, andthat you can get 8 percent returns, net of inflation, over the long term in yourinvestments.
	- If you just dropped that money into a savings account, what would it beworth thirty years later? While that $1,000 would have grown to $2,427 onpaper, inflation would have also “dragged” your returns down. So while itappears you did well, when you factor in inflation your money has the samepurchasing power as it did thirty years ago. Not good.
	- But there’s a twist. If you’d invested your money, it would be worth over$10,000—ten times more!—eclipsing the drag of inflation and giving youincredible results. And that’s just from a one-time investment.
	- why ur friends have not invested yet
		- It’s ironic that people are afraid of “possibly” losing money in the stockmarket, when they will certainly run out of money if they don’t invest.

	- Let’s first dispense with the idea that saying no to spending on certainthings means you’re cheap. If you decide that spending $2.50 on Cokes whenyou eat out isn’t worth it—and you’d rather save that $15 each week for amovie—that’s not being cheap. That’s consciously deciding what you value.Unfortunately, most Americans were never taught how to consciously spend,which means cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love, butspending extravagantly on the things you do.
