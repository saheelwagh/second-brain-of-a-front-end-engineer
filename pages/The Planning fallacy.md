- rational first step -> compare to previous instances -> set realistic as per
- instead we overcommit
- The Planning Fallacy refers to our tendency to underestimate the time it will take to complete a future task despite knowing that similar tasks have taken longer in the past.
	- Contractors underestimate how much time renovations will take.
	- Writers underestimate the amount of time they’ll need to complete a novel. Product managers underestimate how long a new feature will take to build.
	- Elon Musk misses Tesla production timeline after Tesla production timeline. (When asked about his penchant for giving wildly inaccurate predictions, Musk replied “People should not ascribe to malice that which can easily be explained by stupidity.”)
- How to tackle
	- break down into smaller parts and estimate how long each will take
		- more granular -> more realistic
	- pad ur schedule more than u think u need to
		- 20%
	- use historical data to make better predictions
	- limit the scope of work
		- At Doist, we work in four-week project cycles. While we’ve gotten better at planning our work over the years, projects can still fall behind. Instead of extending the timeline, our project squads have started reducing the scope of work mid-cycle.
	- when going to miss a deadline communicate early and often
