- The tough client is ubiquitous
	- no one we work for cares about our code
		- thus have no idea what code change involves
- Demystify the black magic of software
	- take clients inside the box. As early as possible
	- step them through actual code if possible
- define the goals of your application
	- great clients put the application above themselves
	- when app -> most imp part of the project, everything else falls into place
		- base q -> does this make the app better ?
	- establish the goals and decide together
- be enthusiastic and opinionated
	- don't create image of being a mechanic brought on to build the app
	- be an artisan
