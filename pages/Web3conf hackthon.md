	  collapsed:: true
		- most yt comments suggest hardhat
			- The hardhat has very clear and organized documentation. you can find different guides to how to start hardhat CLI and use hardhat core functionality very effectively. everything has been laid out neat and clean for developers to jump-start your blockchain development journey.
			-
			- the best part of the hardhat documentation is that they have provided tutorials for various tasks and functionality available in hardhat which provides best practices for developers and not to beat around the bush. so if you are a new programmer and want to dive into blockchain development , hardhat becomes your first option to start with.
		- truffle
			- truffle is an old player in the market and thus it has the advantage of having more reference around the web on youtube and other blogs as well . so if you are stuck with some concepts or want to know opinions about other people , you will find more resources than hardhat which becomes down side for hardhat
