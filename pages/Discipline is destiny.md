		- Coming up with the idea for a book is a creative pursuit. Actually
		  creating the book is a work of excruciating manual labor, sitting in a chair,
		  grinding out each consecutive sentence—a process not measured in hours
		  or days, but months and years. It’s a marathon of endurance, cognitive and
		  physical.
		- For me, in the last decade, I have run not just a couple of these
		  marathons but twelve of them, back to back to back. That’s roughly 2.5
		  million words across titles I’ve published, articles I’ve written, and the daily
		  emails that I produced in the same period. And on this book—the halfway
		  mark in my series on the four virtues
		- cards from past
		- And guess what? It saved me.
		  Not from the work, of course, but from myself. From giving up. From
		  abandoning the system and process that had served me so well on all those
		  books and articles and emails.

		- If I get to the office at eight thirty, I could be done
		  writing by eleven. Just a couple hours is all it takes. Just a couple crappy
		  pages a day, as one old writing rule puts it. The discipline of writing is
		  about showing up.
		- discipline and enjoying, instead of anger or revenge that was driving him
		- **balanced, more in control of his emotions**
		- As I struggled to write this book, I tried my best to improve in another
		  area of my life—how my work and self-discipline manifests itself at home.
		  Several years ago, after I sold a project, my editor called my wife, in part to
		  congratulate us but also to apologize. She knew what this meant for my
		  wife—what it would do to me, who I became in the dark depths of writing a
		  book.
		- But then, as I worked from home on the final
		  pages on this book, my five-year-old looked up from his art project and
		  said, “I’m sorry you lost your job writing books, Dad.” Apparently things
		  had been so much less crazy and my boundaries had been so much better
		  that he thought I’d been forced into early retirement.
		- If books came naturally, without effort? Everyone would write them.

How often has the afterword of a book become your favourite part of the book ?
(for the peasants : it's the very last section of the book, oftne reflecting on the journey oof writing the book)

The part where he mentioned of maturing. My theme of 2022. We moved houses which meant I had more to do than any year befoe. Contested election so went for campaigning. My deep work schedule should have taken a hit, and it did. But not due to those ext5enal reasons but internal, I had failed to conquer the demons in my head. 

As I reflect on the year, those externalities instead helped me grow as a person. If my goal was to become the most efficient AI at writing code, like chatgpt, it was all a waste. But my goal is to become a thinker above that, and those were all priceless lessons.

I could relate to the part where Ryan, now a father hasx to become more balanced. Not to the part of becoming a father anytime soon, but to owning up responsibilities.

I am takin my firstr major bnreak for my cousin's wedding. The eldest son in the familu more often than not sets the right examples. And Sau dada has been the ideal child nechmark to measure. Did he need to get married to become responsible ? anything but. He has got here by owning up multiple 

In this section Ryan goes in depth about the pains of being a writer. He mentions writing a book is an act of creative pleasure. WHile writing the book is a painful joutney. I can relate to both. 
The first because I have numerous creative pursuits that never saw the light of the day.
Books that did not proceed beyond the first page 
(insert cover)
Apps that did not get a second screen
Websites that did not proceed beyonf the first page.

I relate to the second part because
I did not have the courage or the will
To write that second page, or the thousand after it.
To code the logic for the second screen, or to last through the sleepless nights  trying to fix it
To design that next page because I was scared it doesnt look as good.

But now I have. I can't claim to have the will or the courage unless I am looking back on it . But I sure as do have the curiosity to see it all through.
And to that end, my newsletter : focused curiosity. 
The one trait that separates you from AI.
