		- The most famous example of time affluence encouraging us to help others  is  the  “Good  Samaritan”  study.  In  this  study,  researchers  re-cruited theology students from Princeton, who completed a couple of questionnaires that—in typical psychology study fashion—were bogus, only a means to an end. The students were then asked to schlep across campus  to  a  local  elementary  school  to  teach  the  story  of  the  Good  Samaritan, who helps a downtrodden stranger by the side of the road.
		- some students were told that they were running late and that the class was already waiting for their ar-rival. Other students were told they had several minutes to get to class. On their walk across campus, all students encountered a man slumped over in an alley, moaning in pain. Most of the students who were told they had time stopped to help. But fewer than 10percent of the students who were in a hurry helped the man; most didn’t even take notice.
	- The secret to happier time is simple: prioritize time over money—one decision at a time.

		- In the leftmost column of the table below, list the major events in your life, especially ones involving money, such as choosing a job, choosing where to live, getting married, moving in with someone, having a child, buying a puppy, or taking care of a family member
		- After you have thought about the time costs, consider how you might offset  some  of  these  costs—either  by  making  a  diff  erent  decision  or  by  increasing your focus on time-smart strategies such as funding time, find-ing time, and reframing time. Write those strategies in the last column.
