- make yourself a map
	- But a living application is never done unless it’s on the road to retire-
	  ment. The same is true of you and your career. Unless you’re looking
	  to exit the industry, you need a road map. If Microsoft had consid-
	  ered Windows 3.1 done, we’d all be using Macintoshes right now. If
	  the Apache developers had considered their web server done when
	  they reached 1.0, they might not be overwhelmingly leading the mar-
	  ket right now.
	- Your personal product road map is what you use to tell whether you’ve
	  moved. When you’re going to the same office day in and day out,
	  working on a lot of the same things, the scenery around you doesn’t
	  change. You need to throw out some markers that you can see in the
	  distance, so you’ll know that you’ve actually moved when you get to
	  them. Your product “features” are these markers.
	- Thinking of each new set of knowledge or capability as
	  equivalent to a single feature in an application puts it in context really
	  well. An application with one feature isn’t much of an application.
	- What’s more, an application with a bunch of features that aren’t cohe-
	  sive is going to confuse its users. Is this an address book or a chat appli-
	  cation? Is it a game or a web browser?
	- It can show you
	  that no single feature stands alone. Each new investment is part of a
	  larger whole. Some work fabulously well together. Others require too
	  much of a mental leap for potential employers. Is he a system administra-
	  tor or a graphic designer? Is she an application architect or a QA automation
	  guru?
	- Although it’s definitely OK to learn diverse skills—it expands your
	  thinking—it’s also a good idea to think about the story your skillset
	  tells. Without a road map, your story might look more like a Jack Ker-
	  ouac novel than a cohesive set of logically related capabilities. Without
	  a road map, you might even actually get lost
	- Action items
		- Before mapping out where you want to go, it can be encourag-
		  ing and informative to map out where you’ve been. Take some
		  time to explicitly lay out the timeline of your career.
			- Show where
			  you started and what your skills and jobs were at each step.
			  Notice where you made incremental improvements and where
			  you seemed to make big leaps.
			- Notice the average length of time
			  it took to make a major advancement.
		- he average length of time
		  it took to make a major advancement. Use this map as input as
		  you look forward in your career. You can set more realistic goals
		  for yourself if you have a clear image of your historical progress.
		  Once you’ve created this historical map, keep it updated.
