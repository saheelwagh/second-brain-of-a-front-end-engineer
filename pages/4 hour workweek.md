- The New Rich (NR) are
	- those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles using
		- time and
		- mobility.
- The process
	- D is for Definition. Introductions to the rules and objectives of the new game. This section explains the lifestyle design recipe and fundamentals.
	- E is for Elimination. Kills the obsolete notion of time management once and for all. How to increase your per-hour results ten times or more by cultivating selective ignorance, developing a low-information diet, and ignoring the unimportant. This section provides the first of the three luxury lifestyle design ingredients: time.
	- A is for Automation. Puts cash flow on autopilot using geographic arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of nondecision. Provides the second ingredient of luxury lifestyle design: income.
	- L is for Liberation. The mobile manifesto for the globally inclined. Covers how to break the bonds that confine you to a single location. This section delivers the third and final ingredient for luxury lifestyle design: mobil
- Interest and Energy Are Cyclical. Work only when you are most effective and life is both more productive and enjoyable.
- Less Is Not Laziness. Despite working fewer hours, the NR produce more meaningful results than other people. Focus on being productive instead of busy.
- The Timing Is Never Right. “Someday” is a disease that takes your dreams to the grave with you. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and correct course along the way
- Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair.
- Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good. Eustress is the stimulus for growth. Be equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress.
- Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income. Relative income is the real measurement of wealth for the New Rich. (research this part)

	- Most intelligent people in the world dress up fear as optimistic denial.
	- define ur fear
		- 1. write
		  2. what damage control ?
		  3. whats the upside ?
		  4. repair the missteps
		  5. what one action to take ?
		  6. Know the Costs. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the cost of inaction. If you don’t pursue what excites you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years?
		  7. Understand Your Fear. What are you waiting for? If you can only answer “timing” then you’re afraid, just like the rest of the world. Measure the cost of inaction and realize the unlikelihood and repairability of most missteps. Finally, develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.

	- What would you do if there were no way you could fail? Create two timelines—6 months and 12 months—and list up to five things you dream of having, being, and doing, in that order.
	  What does “being” entail doing? Convert each “being” into a “doing” to make it actionable. For example: Great cook = make Christmas dinner without help.
	  What are the four dreams that would change it all? Highlight the four most exciting and/or important dreams.
	  Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for both timelines. Think of income and expense as a monthly cash flow instead of grand totals. Calculate your Target Monthly Income for your dreamlines.
	  Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6-month timeline and take the first step now. Set simple well-defined actions for now, tomorrow, and the day after. Once you have three steps for each of the four goals, complete the three actions in the “now” column. Each should be simple enough to do in five minutes or less. The best first step is finding someone who’s done it and asking for advice on how to do the same.

		- f you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day, what would you do? 
		  If you had a second heart attack and had to work two hours per week, what would you do?

		- **There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Do them separately from start to finish without distraction.**

	- Which social, industry, and professional groups do you belong to, have you belonged to, or do you understand? Compile a list of all the groups, past and present, that you can associate yourself with.
	- hich of the groups you identified have their own magazines? Narrow the groups from question 1 above to those that are reachable through one or two small magazines.
