- 1st among Why I write posts
- Writing is an act of publishing your thoughts
- Journal or brain dump is the first stage of shipping
- Second stage is publishing -> testing against your own sense of judgement
	- You can be too soft -> kill your babies
	- Or you can be too harsh -> stemming from lack of confidence
		- I believe most of us fall into the second bracket (or we'd see a lot more writers in the wild)
- Third stage is publishing
	- here is the biggest roadblock as it is the most brutal phase
	- But if you get good then also the most rewarding
	- Only way to get good is to keep getting hit and see where you can improve
- Ways to get better -> forced reps
	- only program I would join if I could afford ->s30for30
	- their promise
	- so what is the workaround ?
	- ai ? -> publishgpt
	- set of ai tools to help write online
- wordboard -> foss project
