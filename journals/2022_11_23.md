		- The neurotransmitter adenosine builds up in your system throughout the day; that's one reason you get sleepy. Residual amounts of adenosine still remain in your brain when you wake up; that's one reason you might struggle to get going in the morning.
		- affeine blocks adenosine from binding to receptors in your brain. When adenosine can't bind, you feel, or keep feeling, alert and awake. (Drink enough coffee and you feel *really* awake.)
		- When your body recognizes that adenosine isn't binding, to [paraphrase Jeff Goldblum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiVVzxoPTtg), life finds a way and responds by creating more receptors. [Research shows that within three days of consistent caffeine ingestion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3432916/), the number of adenosine, nicotinic, and muscarinic (modulation of neuronal excitability) receptors is significantly increased.
		- More receptors means more coffee is needed to kick-start your day. More coffee is needed to keep you going. If you let the caffeine wear off, the adenosine "crash" is even bigger.
		- All of which means you start to *really* need that first cup of coffee. And you start to drink more and more coffee throughout the day, if only to avoid the inevitable caffeine-withdrawal headache.
		- Here's the good news. [Research also shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3432916/) that the changes in adenosine receptor levels typically reverse after a seven-day caffeine break. Think of it as a caffeine reset: By reducing your tolerance, you'll increase the boost you will feel when you start drinking coffee again.
