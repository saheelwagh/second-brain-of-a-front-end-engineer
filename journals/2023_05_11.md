	- This workshop starts at a basic problem/solution, and layers up to complex algorithms for a variety of challenging tasks.
	- leave this workshop with
		- practical algorithms knowledge,
		- prepared to tackle problems by first thinking algorithmically and then translating that into efficient code.
	- 1. Learn how “Big O” classification impacts both computation time and memory usage (and the tradeoffs) 2. Explore how data structures (classic and custom) shaped to the nature of the problem lay the groundwork for better algorithms 3. Learn basic techniques for benchmarking computation time and memory usage
