- auth routes [never separate](https://medium.com/@alexey.inkin/never-have-separate-sign-in-routes-7c9a6dd4dc7c)
  collapsed:: true
	- So you should not have a dedicated sign-in URL. Instead you show the sign-in form at any URL that requires authentication.
	- For backend apps, there is usually some sort of server redirects that do not cause an actual HTTP redirect but only route the request internally to another handler.
	- For Flutter apps, I normally do the following:
		- Set up a bloc or any other business logic object that is a source of truth for the authentication state in the app.
		- Make some  `AuthenticatedOrNotWidget`  with two builders: one for an authenticated case and one for a non-authenticated case. This widget listens to the authentication bloc and rebuilds if the authentication data changes. If the user gets signed out, then non-authenticated builders of each screen in the stack will take over. If the user gets signed back in, the authenticated builders will be called back again. As a bonus, this widget automatically rebuilds if something in the user profile has changed.
		- If the screens are backed with blocs or change notifiers, make them inherit some superclass that is aware of authentication and only calls their business methods if the authentication is alright. This architecture is app-specific.
