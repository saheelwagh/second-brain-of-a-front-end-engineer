		- The NPC and Main Character move through reality in the way they do because of their perspective.
		- Your perspective is forged with time through conditioning.
			- Conditioning = the information you process with your mind repeated over time until those thought processes are automatic.
		- Perspective and identity are closely tied.
		- Your identity (your sense of who you are) influences three major things:
			- Your perspective or worldview
			- How you perceive situations from that perspective
			- The choices you make because of both]
		- **Intelligent imitation process**
			- The difference between the NPC and Main Character is that the latter imitates with an intelligent or conscious mind.
			- steps
				- create a perspectiv e you can grow into
				  collapsed:: true
					- The perspective you create will give you a lens to view your present situations through.
					- You “grow into” that perspective through conscious practice.
					- answer these questions
						- What does my ideal day look like?
						- What do I want to do as my life’s work?
						- How do I want to impact people’s lives?
						- What do I want to look and feel like?
						- What values and habits will I have to adopt to bring those to life?
					- From there, practice putting on the perspective of your future self as you go about your days.
					-
				- choose 3-5 mentors
				  collapsed:: true
					- Make this process easy by writing down the 3-5 names of the people that have changed *your* perspective.
					- What is your favorite book that you recommend to everyone? Write down the author’s name.
					- Who is the YouTuber, podcaster, or blogger that you can’t stop watching? The one that “blows your mind” every time they post?
					- What social media accounts do you follow that make you think, “How did they say that so perfectly?”
					- **The combination and *connection* of these “mentors” is how you create your own niche, perspective, and content that separates you from the crowd.**
					-
				- become a mad scientist
				  collapsed:: true
					- you are immersing yourself in information from your mentors and pushing toward your goals, follow the scientific process.
						- **Research** – don’t mindlessly consume content. Gather it to apply to your goals.
						- **Test** – don’t take advice or information as law. Test if it works for your situation.
						- **Experiment** – don’t be dogmatic about one method. Try different diets, business models, and religious ideologies until the truth of each blurs in the middle.
						- **Discover** – note patterns that get results in alignment with your goals.
						- **Document** – write down what gets you results. This is the valuable information that you can sell or leverage.
					- When you treat your life as a project, it becomes profitable.
					- A personal brand is just discovering yourself in public and getting paid for the research you do.
				- create or be created
					- The NPC is created through years of conditioning that remains unconscious.
					- The Main Character is created through years of conscious conditioning (they choose their inputs).

	- [make the most of working mem](https://nesslabs.com/productive-cognitive-load?utm_source=pocket_saves)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Most people think we need to reduce our cognitive load as much as possible. But things are a bit more subtle than that. Certain types of cognitive loads can’t be altered, others are detrimental, and yet others are actually productive.
		- Better thinking requires finding the delicate balance between all the different types of cognitive loads so you can make the most of your working memory.
		- **The paper is often used to argue that the number of objects an average human can hold in their working memory is 7 ± 2, which is known as Miller’s law.**
		- Our cognitive load is the main measure of how “full” our working memory is. When trying to learn something new or navigate your way through complex decision-making, it’s important to take into account and manage your cognitive load—or, more accurately, your cognitive loads.
		- Balancing your mental effort is central to increasing your learning performance. To understand why, let’s have a look at the three types of cognitive loads:
			- **Intrinsic cognitive load.** This is the inherent level of difficulty associated with a specific task. There is no way to alter the intrinsic cognitive load of a task. For instance, it will be easier to solve a simple calculation such as 3 + 3 compared to solving a differential equation.
			- **Extraneous cognitive load.** This is the way the information or task is presented, and can be altered through instructional design. For instance, describing a concept visually or verbally will have an impact on how easy it is to understand.
			- **Germane cognitive load.** **This is the result of how the brain constructively handles information, which contributes to long-term learning. For instance, creating a concept map of a knowledge area will increase your germane cognitive load, which will help you understand and memorise better.**
		- While the intrinsic cognitive load of a task is fixed, it is possible to play with its extraneous and germane cognitive loads. Specifically, in order to learn better, the way we study should strive to reduce our extraneous cognitive load (which is unnecessarily making it harder to think) and increase our germane cognitive load (which is helping us think better, even if it feels like more work).
		- tools
			- **Chunking.** Take individual pieces of information and group them into larger units. This method has been [shown](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DOYJCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT12&dq=tulving%2C%20E.%2C%20%26%20Craik%2C%20F.%20I.%20M.%20(2000).%20The%20Oxford%20handbook%20of%20memory.%20Oxford%3A%20Oxford%20University%20Press.&pg=PT12#v=onepage&q=tulving,%20E.,%20&%20Craik,%20F.%20I.%20M.%20(2000).%20The%20Oxford%20handbook%20of%20memory.%20Oxford:%20Oxford%20University%20Press.&f=false) to improve the amount of information you can remember, as the chunks are able to be retrieved more easily due to their coherent familiarity.
			- **Thinking in maps.** From [mind maps](https://nesslabs.com/mind-mapping) to process maps and concept maps, [thinking in maps](https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps) is a great way to reduce the extraneous cognitive load of a task and increase its germane cognitive load by helping you form constructive associatiations.
			- **Brain dumping.** A brain dump is a mind-clearing tool which helps take thoughts out of your mind and on paper, so you can better visualise them. It can be used as a precursor to creating a map.
			- **Writing.** Many authors agree that [writing is thinking](https://nesslabs.com/writing-thinking-tool). It’s been shown to help better understand content and improve your memory. To make the most of the [generation effect](https://nesslabs.com/generation-effect), use the [Feynman Technique](https://nesslabs.com/feynman-technique).
			- **Collaborating.** The title of [this research paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-008-9095-2) says it all: *A Cognitive Load Approach to Collaborative Learning: United Brains for Complex Tasks*. Collaborative learning has been [found](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-008-9095-2) to help improve learning performance, especially with high cognitive load tasks. Strategies include brainstorming solutions or creating a learning plan as a group.

	- [fail like a scientist](https://nesslabs.com/fail-like-a-scientist?utm_source=pocket_saves)
	  collapsed:: true
		- To fail like a scientist is to embrace the experimental nature of life. Everything is an experiment, every failure a learning opportunity. It’s about [having a growth mindset](https://nesslabs.com/growth-mindset)—where uncertainty is a positive sign that you are learning and growing.
		- Scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs have this mindset in common. Picasso produced an [estimated](http://www.gelonchviladegut.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/PICASSO-QUOTATIONS1.pdf) 50,000 pieces of art. Thomas Edison [famously](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanfurr/2011/06/09/how-failure-taught-edison-to-repeatedly-innovate/) said he failed 10,000 times before inventing the lightbulb. 26 out of 27 publishers rejected The Four Hour Workweek by Tim Ferris. Before she signed a deal, 36 publishers rejected Arianna Huffington’s book. Despite these initial failures, they all kept on going.
		- **Replace imitation with exploration.** Imitation feels safe. Many creatives and entrepreneurs stick to what they consider step-by-step playbooks from successful people. In some cases, it is possible to reproduce part of someone else’s success by applying a formula, but true breakthroughs never happen through pure imitation. Instead, take the road less traveled to explore new paths.
		- **Ask good questions.** Avoid empty interrogations where the answer is already included in the question. Two of the most powerful questions you can ask yourself are “Why?” and “What if?” but sometimes, simply asking “How?” can lead to powerful new knowledge. [Asking questions](https://nesslabs.com/good-questions) is an art which is great to practice both with other people—as part of a conversation—or on your own—as part of your self-reflection practice.
		- **Build a learning loop.** Take inspiration from the scientific method to design your very own [learning loop](https://nesslabs.com/learning-loops). Decide on an hypothesis, design an experiment, and learn from the feedback to improve your initial [mental model](https://nesslabs.com/mental-models).
		- **Celebrate progress over success.** Instead of focusing on the finish line and our biggest achievement, take the time to [celebrate your micro-wins](https://nesslabs.com/micro-wins)—the small, daily victories and incremental accomplishments. Submitted an article to a publication? Don’t wait until you hear back from the editor to give yourself a pat on the back. Finally managed to fix a bug in your code? Make yourself a nice hot chocolate with extra cocoa on top. Learning is all about the journey, and the journey can be long—may as well make it enjoyable.
		- **Block time for reflection.** Sometimes we get so busy with work, we forget to apply these scientific principles. [Journaling](https://nesslabs.com/tag/journaling) is a great way to reflect on your progress. If you would like to use a more structured approach to self-reflection, the [weekly review](https://nesslabs.com/weekly-review) is also a great activity to incorporate in your mindful productivity routine.

	- [Mindframing](https://nesslabs.com/mindframing-guide?utm_source=pocket_saves)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Mindframing is a method that’s mindful of the way we think, feel, and work. Instead of blindly cranking tasks, it’s about creating growth loops with constant feedback so you can be mindful of the way you achieve your goals. Mindframing is about continuous learning, personal growth, and [mindful productivity](https://nesslabs.com/mindful-productivity). It’s about being the best you can while acknowledging the inherent flaws of your humanity.
		- Keyframes
			- **Growth mindset.** Read [this article](https://nesslabs.com/growth-mindset) to learn about the two mindsets shaping your work and life, how to identify your mindset triggers, the principles of neuroplasticity and how to foster a growth mindset.
			- **Metacognition.** Then, read [this one](https://nesslabs.com/metacognition) to learn about the tools and methods you can use to “think about thinking”, the second major mindframe you need to master. You will learn how to regulate your metacognition through planning, monitoring, and evaluating your creative and intellectual work.
			- **Self-authorship.** Finally, read to learn how you can create a coherent belief system and how you can shape your identity. This article includes a list of activities to develop your self-authorship.
		- According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a [mind frame](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mind%20frame) is a mental attitude or outlook. It’s more than just a mood, it encompasses the particular way someone thinks or feels about something, and deeply influences one’s behaviour.
		- There are four steps to the mindframing method:
			- Pact
				- First, you create a **pact**, either with yourself or with others. I’m personally a big proponent of learning and building in public, but if you feel like you have the [mental resilience and emotional strength](https://nesslabs.com/emotional-agility) to keep yourself accountable without sharing your goals with others, that’s fine too. There are also cases where you may not want to build your product in the open for other practical reasons.
			- Act
				- First, you create a **pact**, either with yourself or with others. I’m personally a big proponent of learning and building in public, but if you feel like you have the [mental resilience and emotional strength](https://nesslabs.com/emotional-agility) to keep yourself accountable without sharing your goals with others, that’s fine too. There are also cases where you may not want to build your product in the open for other practical reasons.
				- I made a pact to write one new article every week day on this blog (please note I realise it would be a pretty ambitious pact for people who are just getting started with blogging, and your pact needs to feel reasonable). So I blocked an hour every day, first thing in the morning, to sit down and write. [Blocking time](https://nesslabs.com/time-management) in your calendar will both help you act on your decision to achieve your goal, and also build a habit so it becomes progressively easier to stick to it.
			- React
				- Third, you need to **react**. This is when you start really internalising the concepts you have previously engaged with by creating your own content. I know it can sound daunting to start producing content at this stage. You feel like you’re such a newbie—who are you to share your thoughts about a topic that’s so new to you?
				- But this is one of the most efficient ways to learn, with the added bonus of helping you connect with people who are also interested in the topic. This could take many forms: a blog post, a short podcast, a live stream, a thread on Twitter, an email to your list. This article is actually me consolidating lots of the stuff I’ve been learning in the past years. Reframing and explaining your thoughts to someone is a great way to consolidate yours.
			- Impact
				- Once you feel familiar enough—which means that you can grasp the concepts and can articulate them, but still feel very uncomfortable using them—you should start creating something bigger. If you’re learning how to code, time to try building your first complex application. If you’re studying ancient history, time to write longer essays about a little-studied topic and submit them to relevant publications. If you’re studying music composition, time to create a collection of original pieces.

					- Instead of reading a lot of random pieces of content on interesting topics, deciding to write about what you read, watch, or listen to will force you to do a little bit or preliminary research to make sure you select high quality information sources to learn from. Since you won’t have enough time to read all the material available about a specific topic—which would have been true regardless of your decision to write about it or not—you will become more intentional with your [information diet](https://nesslabs.com/information-diet).

From consuming information to creating your own content, writing can be used every step of the way.
					- ## Write to select what content to consume
					  
					  By deciding you will write a short note about everything you read, you will naturally slow down and reduce your content consumption levels. You may think that’s a bad thing—after all, you’re a curious mind and want to learn as much as possible. This is exactly how writing about the content you consume can help.

Since you won’t have enough time to read all the material available about a specific topic—which would have been true regardless of your decision to write about it or not—you will become more intentional with your [information diet](https://nesslabs.com/information-diet).
					- ## Write to better understand content
					  
					  “Ce qui se conçoit bien, s’énonce clairement,” once said Boileau (1636-1711), a French writer. It could be translated to: “What is clearly thought out is clearly expressed.” This is the principle behind the [Feynman Technique](https://nesslabs.com/feynman-technique), named after Richard Feynman (1918–1988), a Nobel-prize winning physicist who has been dubbed [The Great Explainer](https://amzn.to/2ZNcp24). (Bill Gates called him “the greatest teacher I never had.”)
					  
					  > 
					  
					  “Without using the new word which you have just learned, try to rephrase what you have just learned in your own language.” — Richard Feynman, Physicist.
					  
					  Anytime you struggle to write about something you just read, watched, or listen, make sure to take the time to understand properly. The fact that you’re struggling to express it in your own words often means you haven’t completely grasped the new idea.
					- ## Write to improve your memory
					  
					  Writing is being kind to your future self. The [generation effect](https://nesslabs.com/generation-effect), which was described in a research paper published in 1978 in the *Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior*, is the phenomenon where information is better remembered if it is actively created from one’s own mind rather than simply read in a passive way.
					  
					  Instead of passively taking notes, writing what you want to learn in your own words ensures you are in active learning mode, and form connections between new and pre-existing knowledge, which will make it easier to retrieve information later on.
					  
					  And if your memory inevitably fails you, you will always be able to go back to your notes to refresh it. It may even be the opportunity to edit your existing note to add more information or rephrase it in a way that’s more memorable to you.
					- ## Write to create unique content
					  
					  While creativity in the conventional sense of the term is a myth, combinational creativity relies on your ability to connect existing ideas together to create new ideas. To be able to form such connections, you need a way to retrieve, explore, and edit ideas that pop into your mind. Writing is a great way to create such a searchable database of ideas so you can connect some of them together and generate your own ideas.
					  
					  Most unique content is created by exploring a topic or addressing a problem from a new angle. Writing your thoughts down will help you track the evolution of your thinking and provide unique material to create unique content. While many people have the same thoughts, the pathway to these thoughts is often different from mind-to-mind. Track the life of your thoughts and share the journey with others.
					- ## Write to receive feedback
					  
					  [Write in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public). Sharing your work multiplies the power of writing. By sharing your work—”working with the garage door open” as Robin Sloan [said](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)—you create a feedback loop allowing you to improve your thinking, and maybe even learn something new or discover a different way to tackle a problem.
					- Don’t wait until you have a perfect draft of an article. Consider [building a digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) so people can comment on your work in progress and early ideas ([this is mine](https://www.mentalnodes.com/)). Share in order to learn, not in order to shine. Incorporate relevant feedback in your next draft.
