		- Is writing something you already feel self-motivated about and have some itch to do? Do you feel off if you haven't published something in a while? Is your first instinct when you get interested in something to write about it? Congrats, you have the writing itch! Ignore any compulsion to stick to a schedule. If you're doing a blog like this one, you'll be fine whether you publish once a month or once a day.
		- That's not to say you shouldn't publish frequently, only that you shouldn't publish only to publish something. Especially if you have a well-defined niche, you're going to run out of topics or repeat yourself or [overcomplicate it](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/decomplication) eventually.

		- This schedule is temporary. It's to get you in the habit of putting your work out there regularly and to develop the itch for writing. But as soon as writing is a habit you’re “pulled” to do, ditch the schedule and focus on quality.
		- Start by publishing often until you have more article ideas than you'll ever have time to write, and until you know you'll keep writing without a fixed schedule.
		- Again, there's no right answer here. I'll sometimes go 3-4 months without a new post. [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/) publishes every day. [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) once went a year and a half without publishing.
		- Find a cadence that works for you to produce work you're proud of.
		- It's the posts you spend the longest thinking about that will land the biggest splash. Not necessarily the ones you spend the longest writing. But the longest thinking about and preparing for. This post has been 6 years in the making, so I'm cautiously optimistic it'll do quite well.
		- The longer you've spent thinking about a topic, the more you'll probably have to say, which is why most of your posts should tend towards being longer. If you're not used to writing long articles, keep trying to see what else you can say about whatever you're writing about. If your interest in the subject only lasts 500 words, it's probably not a great post. Most of mine end up being at least 1,000 words, often 2,000+
		- As a simple example, I have one of the most popular [intro articles about Roam](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam). I've only written one article about Roam, and only published three videos, but those pieces alone were enough to make me an authority on Roam and be the marketing for [my course](https://learn.nateliason.com/).
		- That's a combination of good SEO, and good curation. People don't want to read 10 articles or 30 guides. They want one great resource. Your job is to create a great resource for whatever you're writing about.
		-
	- niche
	  collapsed:: true
		- I don't recommend picking a niche for a personal site. This site talks about the most random assortment of topics possible. There's marketing, writing, reading, productivity, finance, psychology, hunting, a card game, dog training, drugs, sex, it's varied to say the least.
		- The only common theme is they're all topics I'm interested in at the time of writing. The biggest challenge isn't writing consistently, it's finding topics so interesting that you’ll write something great about them.
		- Every successful blogger I know of who started out focused on one niche eventually broadened away from it, and ended up branding under their own name. A narrow niche might help you get started, but you'll outgrow it and want to build authority under your own name eventually, so why not start there.

			- This article is an example of a "things you know" post, as is my popular "[wiki strategy](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/wiki-strategy)" post. That article was inspired by my work doing content marketing and SEO for a few different sites, and publishing it led to the influx of leads that motivated me to start [Growth Machine](https://www.growthmachine.com/).
				- To write a "things you know" post, take any topic you’re interested in and share your knowledge on it. You don't need to be the top expert in the world. You need to have something useful to add to the conversation. Or, you need to show you know enough about an area to be taken seriously on it

			- As another example, I wrote about [how to learn digital marketing](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/learn-digital-marketing) based on my experience quickly learning enough of it in college to get hired. Are there better digital marketers out there? Of course. But my experience was useful for other people trying to figure out how to get started in this field, and it's been read some 50,000 times:
			-
		- things excited about
			- My [Roam article](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam) is a good example of this. I started using Roam and was excited about it, so I shared why it was exciting to me and how I was using it.
			- That post hit the front page of Hacker News, and has been read almost 100,000 times since it was published:
			- The same could be said of my [water fasting article](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/5-day-water-fast-health-benefits). I decided to try a 5-day water fast back before it was cool, wrote about the experience doing it, and now it has been read almost 3,000,000 times in the last 5 years.
		- things u believe
			- My favorite example of this is my "[is soylent healthy](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/soylent)" article. I wrote it after being annoyed by otherwise intelligent people who were treating this frankenfood like an acceptable dietary supplement, so I wrote about everything I believed was wrong with it.
			- That obviously pissed off the soylent fanboys. There were debates about the article on reddit, and creating that controversy drove a bunch of traffic:
			- Another example I feel a little bad about is my "[no more struggle porn](https://medium.com/@nateliason/no-more-struggle-porn-202153a01108)" article. I don't disagree with anything I said, but I feel bad it turned into everyone being mean to Gary Vaynerchuk instead of criticizing the unhealthy hustle culture. But, the reaction to it was certainly explosive. It was one of the 20 most read Medium articles that year, with over 461,000 views total:
			- My article on [why you should delete Facebook](https://medium.com/s/story/yes-you-should-delete-facebook-heres-why-bc623a3b4625) was similarly well received, with people piling on to criticize Facebook's horrible privacy standa
			- A good heuristic for this kind of article is, if you're thinking "ehhh maybe I shouldn't write about that" then you should probably write about it. Most people are playing it safe with their content. Have an opinion and write something more interesting.

	  collapsed:: true
		- But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do any marketing. It means marketing for a personal site has to come after you decide what to write. You shouldn't go do a bunch of [keyword research](https://www.growthmachine.com/blog/keyword-research) and then use that to decide your posts. That'll make it hard to write about topics compelling to you.
		- There are three kinds of promotion for a site like this (in increasing order of importance):
			- surge traffic
				- This traffic is fantastic for getting new people to discover your work, but it's temporary. Surges last a few days at best, then the virality ends and you're back where you started, with only a few more people following what you're doing.
				- Long term, surge traffic is the least repeatable and least useful form of promotion to focus on. But in the beginning before you have a few thousand people on your email list, it's the best tool you have to quickly grow your audience.
				- srces
					- **Social virality**: You wrote a post people love, so it gets picked up on social media and is shared like crazy.
					- **Influencers**: Someone with a big audience found what you wrote and shared it.
					- **Communities**: Your piece performed well in an online community with an active userbase, and they all checked it out.
				- evergreen traffic
					- o how do you get evergreen traffic? Well, the biggest way is through SEO. If you can write a post on a topic people are searching in Google, and have your post show up in the top few spots for that search query, you're going to keep getting traffic for a long long time.
					- For example, my water fasting article is about [my experience doing a water fast](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/5-day-water-fast-health-benefits), but I looked up what other details I should include to make it more competitive for the water fasting related keywords. Same with my [passive income](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/passive-income) article.
					- I also get a ton of SEO value from [my book notes](https://nateliason.com/notes). Almost a quarter of all my traffic is organic visitors to my book notes:
					- And I don't even do anything particularly SEO-driven with them, But I have a ton of them (over 250!) and each one ranks well for the book's keywords, so all together they bring in a nice little stream of traffic.
				- audience traffic
					-
	- monetization
	  collapsed:: true
		- This site never made more than $100 in a month for the first couple years. Monetization was not the goal. But if you work on something long enough and build an audience, opportunities to monetize naturally follow.
		- You should focus on building an audience and sustainable traffic before you focus on monetization. If no one is coming to your site, it doesn't matter if you tweak your CTAs or try new ads layouts. Get the audience, and the revenue will follow.
		- [The Brain](https://www.nateliason.com/brain) had a similar inspiration. My book notes were starting to get more traffic, but their value was limited by being standalone pages. So, I created an Evernote notebook of all my highly annotated notes, turned it into a product, and started selling it on all the book notes pages:
		- https://learn.nateliason.com/
		- What’s the lesson here? Well, if a few of your smart friends tell you to make something you're also motivated to make, it's worth taking a stab at. And when you make something that does well (in this case, the Roam article) and there's a clear way to double down, you should go for it.
		- Growth Machine will do somewhere between $2.5 and $4 million in revenue this year, so in many ways it's the REAL biggest product from this site. We have 12 full-time people now, employ 30-40+ contractors, and get to work with some of the coolest tech startups and ecommerce companies. And it all started with [this article](https://nateliason.com/blog/wiki-strategy).
		- That shouldn’t deter you though. I don’t know a single person with a personal site who regrets investing in it. But I know a number of people without personal sites who wish they’d started one sooner.
		- If you want a series of quick wins to build momentum, get your site built (remember, don’t overthink here!) and try to get 10 articles done in the next month. You don’t even have to show them to anyone. Start getting yourself in the habit, and I promise (promise promise promise) it gets easier over time.
