	- With time-blocking (as a beginner):
		- My days were overly planned.
		- Life felt too mechanical.
		- I clocked in the hours to achieve my long-term goals but paradoxically failed to enjoy the present.
	- With time-blocking (as a veteran):
		- I found the perfect balance of planning and spontaneity.
		- Planning allows for disciplined action and builds purpose that causes me to take my life seriously. Spontaneity allows me to be free enough to make decisions at the moment which allows me to not take life too seriously. Ah! The perfect balance.
		- Planning allows me to build my future. Spontaneity allows me to enjoy my present.
