	- So far have the following: an ad auction site where you can bid higher than the previous bid to display your ad on the site, a voting manager site where you can create time-sensitive elections, become a candidate and/or vote for a candidate, and now I’m working on a simple staking site where you can earn a reward token for staking either my fake native token and/or listed LP tokens over time and I plan on taking inspiration for the synthetix staking contract and the Masterchef V2 contract! Sorry that was a lot but would love to hear if that’s a great start! Planning on looking into building a NFT minter and a DEX next :)
