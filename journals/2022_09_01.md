	- For this first exercise, I want you to see how you can shift between the far and near modes of thinking with your own goals.
	- Let’s start with a goal you’re working on. To shift further into far-mode, you can think about:
	- Things you’d like to accomplish in the very long-term
	  Imagine what it would be like to have achieved your goal already
	  Ask yourself how achieving this goal lines up with your values in life
	  Now, consider shifting into near-mode:
	- Take one concrete step towards the goal right now
	  Look through your calendar this week and plan out exactly how you’re going to work on the goal
	  Try to vividly imagine working on the goal, this week. What does it feel like?
	  These are just rough exercises, but getting an intuition about the differences between them is helpful to figuring out how they impact the goals you set!
