	- n the left sidebar, you can switch between the File Explorer, the Solidity Compiler, the Deployer, and an Extensions panel.
	- compile
	- Remix ships with a Javascript VM - which is a simulator of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the browser. This allows for fast testing and debugging of your smart contract, as long as your contract doesn't depend on another contract deployed to a real Ethereum network. Thankfully, our Storage contract does not, so we can test it right here in the Javascript VM.
	- Along with the Javascript VM, Remix creates a set of fake accounts, all loaded up with 100 ETH, to test with.
	- can call the public functions of the deployed conmtracts
	- draw viz to show how this simplifies the loop
	- None of these function calls/transactions we made opened up your digital wallet (Metamask). This is because we are testing in the Javascript VM currently, and that is just a simulator working with fake accounts. When deploying to a real network (Testnet or mainnet), transactions need to be confirmed and signed through your digital wallet.
