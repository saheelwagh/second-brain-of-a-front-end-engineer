- How webflow got my agency unstuck
  collapsed:: true
	- the feedback loop between css and output is too long for beginners
	- have to set up the structure first using scaffolding and that itself is energy consuming
	- webflow let me qucikly translate the designs into layout
	- while figma works for someone with design mindset, webflow lets you operate in css developer mindset which is why I do not refer to it as a nocode tool but a code as a service tool
- redefining monday for solopreneurs
  collapsed:: true
	- I used to consider mondays as the day to work the hardest. Burn all your oil and then recharge over the rest of the week.
	- But not a smart strategy as Brain  engine is not warmed up on monday. Also there are far too many unknowns to solve for. Better to work smart and instead think hard and communicate even harder.
	- make the rest of the week easier to work. Set up the processes and plan ur breaks (so u dont end up hating your work)
	- also approximate your working hours and you must note down your peak hours by end of monday
