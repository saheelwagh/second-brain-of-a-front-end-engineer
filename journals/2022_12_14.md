- Morning Brain Dump
  collapsed:: true
	- Less is more -> for locus of control
		- I had thought it is essential to plan the first action of the morning. It probalby is essential to plan ur frog -> essential outcome at  end of your morining deep work. But it might be ok to be a little spontaneous with your warmup routine. What I can do is choose an area (or 3) -> hop onto yt and go through those videos. Similarly aim to have lesser control over other things. Especially writing and designing. Don't go for full concepts. Explode little pieces into full content.
		- Also professionally. Admit your shortcomings and embrace the new reality. Work your way around it instead of bulldozing(which you can't).
	- One person productozation review
		- will have to build around writing -> hence very imp to write every morning and journal every  evening
		- dating advice for self improvement -> paid email course ? notion template ?
		- agency course -> 6 months. till then some other tool
	- ethindia grant
		- localisation
		- book summaries on ipfs with provision to pay

  collapsed:: true
	- I think rust has 2 main problem for beginners.
	  1. Borrow Checker, obviously. (But this got a lot better since NLL update)
	  2. Trait mindset, almost everything in rust revolve around traits. You need to understand its concept and principal. This concept help me immensely when trying to debug or modify an external library.
	  1. Pointer and smart pointer. 
	  2. Cloning vs automatic Copy
	  1. Boxing, RC.
	  1. Closure, especially async closure which is FnMut
	  2. Async, with Sync+Send constraint.
	- With regards to the DX I think we should separate out the language and the tooling. 
	  The language is quite a bit more complicated than typescript and designing good API's is particularly challenging. Typescript is quite a bit better, but some of the dynamic stuff I encounter when js leaks through can really throw me off.
	  That said I think a lot of the difficulty comes from unfamiliarity. Rust has some rather unique concepts, that take a while to get accustomed to.
	  The tooling side is a bit of a different story. I really love cargo, but rust-analyzer has a lot of room for improvement and refinement. It is improving quickly though. I don't foresee it matching the massive investment Microsoft puts into Typescript but I'm confident that the tooling experience will get a lot closer.
	- Learning rust has made me so much better at typescript and likely every other language
