	  project kickoff which is a four-step process you can instantly Implement in your own life and I think it's a really great framework
	  
	  first Define what winning looks like it's always surprised me how few people take the time to sit down
	  
	  before launching into a project to chalk the field and to say this is what a win looks like and as a result most people just go through life feeling like they're failing at practicall y everything
	  
	  the thing that's crazy is that you get to make the rules of the game that you're playing so winning can look however you want it to so when you're defining what winning looks like get crystal clear on what would be a good outcome and what would be a hell yeah outcome like damn that went way better than expected
	  
	  set two clear and measurable goals one is your
	  
	  ambitious goal and the other is you'reover the moon goal now in both of these cases you want to set goals that are both measurable and have a timeline so that could be I want to lose 15 pounds by February 15th or I want to make an a dditional 10 thousand dollars by the end of this month whatever like I saidyou get to Define what winning lookslike
	- next you're gonna set anti-goals which is simply a way of saying I don't want to hit this goal if it means this this or this happens for example I don't want to lose 15 pounds if it means I can't go out to dinner once a week with
	  
	  my partner or I don't want to make an extra ten thousand dollars this month ifit means I'll have to miss more thanthree of my kids soccer game
	  
	  youranti-goals are very personal to you andit's a way of articulating you know what  price you are and are not willing to payin pursuit of a goal
	  
	  the third step is to create your back of the envelope roadmap this is not to be confused with a robust business plan or step-by-step process you intend to follow to the Tall you're trying to do here is get enough perspective on the major Milestones that you're targeting along with maybe likely roadblocks and pain
	  
	  points are going to hit along the way and the only reason that you do this is so that you have some vague idea of where you're headed and so you have some concept for the obstacles that are going to pop up
	  
	  the reason that most people fail to make meaningful progress is they succumb to analysis paralysis in this stage they never implement the plan and they never take action so don't let this be you you're not aiming for Perfection here you're just striving for good enough so that you can move on tothe fourth and final step which is tosit down and get one hour of momentum and this is that magical place where
	  
	  rubber meets the road where motivation is transformed into traction it is themost important part of the entireprocess the goal here is to take onehour of massive meaningful action maybethat's building out a functional landingpage or outlining a new product andpresenting it to a friend for feedbackor maybe it's outlining a new bookwhatever it is ideally at the end ofthis hour you have something to show foryour effort something that you can holdup and say heck yeah look what I did andif you do this you'll have done thehardest part you'll have taken an objectat rest and completely changed its
	  
	  relationship to the world now it'smoving and if you just keep injectingenergy into the system with speed it'lljust keep going faster and faster untilit becomes Unstoppable because you'llhave tapped into the underlying fabricof reality which States an object inmotion tends to stay in motion now thisis a concept you can leverage to dopretty much anything in life especiallymaking money because now you understandyou see the truth of why money lovesspeed
