- OKRS
  collapsed:: true
	- at a glance
	  collapsed:: true
		- Objectives are ambitious and may feel somewhat uncomfortable
		  Key results are measurable and should be easy to grade with a number (Google uses a scale of 0 – 1.0)
		  OKRs are public so that everyone in the organization can see what others are working on
		  The “sweet spot” for an OKR grade is 60% – 70%; if someone consistently fully attains their objectives, their OKRs aren’t ambitious enough and they need to think bigger
		  Low grades should be viewed as data to help refine the next OKRs
		  OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations
		  OKRs are not a shared to-do list
	- 2 key qs
		- 1. Where do I want to go ?
		  2. How will I pace myself to get there ?
	- stretch goals
	  collapsed:: true
		- Google often sets goals that are just beyond the threshold of what seems possible, sometimes referred to as “stretch goals”. Creating unachievable goals is tricky as it could be seen as setting a team up for failure. However, more often than not, such goals can tend to attract the best people and create the most exciting work environments. Moreover, when aiming high, even failed goals tend to result in substantial advancements.
		- The key is clearly communicating the nature of stretch goals and what are the thresholds for success. Google likes to set OKRs such that success means achieving 70% of the objectives, while fully reaching them is considered extraordinary performance.
		- Such stretch goals are the building blocks for remarkable achievements in the long term, or “moonshots”.
