- Rome wasnt built in a night. Accepting your mediocrity
  collapsed:: true
	- There was one recurring mirage in my dark times.
	- I felt like I will solve this problem only if I work on it overnight
		- build a site
		- study a module
	- The underlying problem was, I was afraid of facing the known
	- the night presents a set of unknowns
		- there is litreally no one disturbing you
		- time does not seem to flow as fast as day
		- sleep is something which we take for granted. feels unproductrive
	- what is the solution ?
		- learn about your body. specificallly sleep. find out your breaking point
			- breaking point is where u have to fall asleep. U become a zombie beyond this.
			- I have learnt that I am productive till 1:30 am. Post which a wind down routine is necessary.
			- plan till then. keep buffer hour ready cz if u r really focused work then u will get tired quicker.
		- get honest about avl time u have left to get ur work done
		- work till that, and learn to let go during sleep. Your body will thank you.\
