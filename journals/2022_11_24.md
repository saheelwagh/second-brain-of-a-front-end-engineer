			- we hv learnt models such as buckets for vars but some are wrong
			- fast coding may lead to bugs but slow coding is slow hence requires right moental models
			- Whenever we can, we rely on the “fast” system, which is good at pattern matching and “gut reactions.” We share this system (which is necessary for survival!) with many animals, and it gives us amazing powers like the ability to walk without falling over. But it’s not good at planning.
			- Uniquely, thanks to the development of the frontal lobe, humans also possess a “slow” thinking system. This “slow” system is responsible for complex step-by-step reasoning. It lets us plan future events, engage in arguments, or follow mathematical proofs.
			- Because using the “slow” system is so mentally draining, we tend to default to the “fast” one—even when dealing with intellectual tasks like coding.

			- When we use the “fast” system, we guess what the code does based on its overall structure, naming conventions and comments. Using the “slow” system, we retrace what the code does step by step—a tiring and time-consuming process.

		- the js universe (values and primititves)
		  collapsed:: true
			- As we start building our mental model, one of the first common misconceptions we need to clear up is that values *are* our code. Instead, we need to think of them separately—our code interacts with values, but values exist in a completely separate space.

				- I’m standing on a small planet, holding a list of instructions. This list is my program—my code. As I read through my list of instructions, I can see a lot going on—there are  `if`  statements, variable declarations, commas and curly braces.
				- My code contains instructions like “make a function call,” “do this thing many times,” or even “throw an error.” I read through these instructions step by step from the surface of my little world.
				- *But every once in a while, I look up.*
					- I see the different values in the JavaScript sky: booleans, numbers, strings, symbols, functions and objects,  `null`  and  `undefined` —oh my! I might refer to them in my code, but they don’t exist *inside* my code.
			- primitives
				- **Primitive values** are like stars—cold and distant, but always there when I need them. Even from the surface of my small planet, I can find them and point them out. They can be numbers and strings, among other things. All primitive values have something in common: **They are a permanent part of our JavaScript universe. I can point to them, but I can’t create, destroy, or change them.**

			- when are undefined used and when null ?
				- und for unintentionally missing vals. null for intent missing
			- everything else in an object. even fns
				- but lthough code like  `"hi".toUpperCase()`  makes  `"hi"`  seem like an object, this is nothing but an illusion. JavaScript creates a temporary object when you do this, and then immediately discards it. It’s fine if this mechanism doesn’t click for you yet. It is indeed rather confusing!
			-
		- expressions
			- **Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer. JavaScript answers expressions in the only way it knows how—with values.**
			- If the word “expression” confuses you, think of it as a piece of code that *expresses* a value. You might hear people say that  `2 + 2`  “results in” or “evaluates to”  `4` . These are all different ways to say the same thing.
			- **Expressions always result in a single value.**
