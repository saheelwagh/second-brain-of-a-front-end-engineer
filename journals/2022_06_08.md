			- Target Audience
			  Brand Personality
			  Consumer insights, what do we know about potential customers
			  Brand experiences, how people will feel with it
			  Words to avoid
			  The warm up – 12 words related to your brand that you life
			  For each word:
			  Go to the thesauraus and plug it in, write down any other great words you find
			  Go to Google Images and search for images related to the words you like
			  Comb through glossaries of terms related to the images and words
			  Read the dictionary definitions for more ideas and to find related phrases
			  Find cliches that use the word
			  Look through songs, books, movies with the words in them
			  Collect all your name ideas from 7, see what passes the SMILE and SCRATCH test, and see what you like!
		- review
			- Write out how the name might be used in a sentence at the top
			  Don’t ask “do I like it?” but ask “is it right?”
			  Refrain from negative comments
			  Don’t ask for outside opinions, or post surveys. If you ask everyone to chime in, you will end up with a mediocre name that met with the least resistance rather than the very best name.
			  Don’t be afraid to be different (Google, Virgin, Lush, Tesla, Apple)
			  Don’t look up domain names early, you can always modify it (teslamotors, steampowered, slideshare.net)
