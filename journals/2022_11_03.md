	- Should we boycott FDs just because they give lower interest rate?
	- Absolutely not.
	- For goals which are less than 1-2 years away, FDs are still the best investment option.
	- I'm talking about saving for Iceland vacation, iPhone 14, new car etc.
	- They are even able to beat most short-term debt funds because before 3 years the tax treatment is the same for both.
	- I'm not talking about FDs from nationalised bank such as HDFC, ICICI, Canara bank, SBI etc which give 5-6% FD returns, which they publicise like the cure to cancer.
	- I'm talking about FD from Small Finance banks which give 7-8% returns and often not talked about.
	- The only catch is that these banks are comparatively riskier, since they lend to small business and farmers.
	- But there is a hack !!
	- If you invest less than 5 lakhs in a Small Finance Bank, then RBI has got your back since they insure it.
	- This 5 lakhs is inclusive of interest earned, so I would say don't invest more than 4 lakhs in a Small Finance bank FD, if you have more than one multiple accounts in other people's name or in a different bank all together.
