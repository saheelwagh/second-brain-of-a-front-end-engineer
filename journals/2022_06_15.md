		- brine -> take a bowl of warm water and add a bit of salt to it. Add the chicken into the brine and let it rest for 15 minutes or more if you can spare the time. Cover the bowl and refrigerate it for 6 hours
		- Brush -> brush the chicken liberally on both sides with butter or olive oil. Then rub it with dried spices like cumin, pepper, cayenne pepper, cajun seasoning, mint, parsley or anything you desire.
		- roast -> at a low temperature for about 30 minutes or at high heat for 15 minutes.
		- rest -> The final and most crucial step is to let it rest. Once you pull your baking tray out of the oven, cover it with aluminum foil and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes.

	- rules
	  collapsed:: true
		- 1. After you wash the chicken, pat it dry before you season or oil it.
		  2. In an oven, chicken is exposed to dry heat which means it's stripped of all its juices. This is why it's crucial that you oil your chicken well before pushing it into the oven.
		  3. Another way to get moist chicken is by covering it with a parchment paper. Make sure you tuck it in so that the chicken is covered from all sides.
		  4. If you're cooking chicken breast, make sure you flatten them so that all of them cook in time.
		  6. The thighs, wings etc. will take more time to cook but pull out the breast as soon as it changes colour from pink to white
		- temp
			- Chicken breasts are devoid of fat and to make sure they don't run out of moisture you either need to wrap them in foil, marinate them with a layer of sauce or cook them in liquid. They won't take more than 15 to 20 minutes in the oven.
