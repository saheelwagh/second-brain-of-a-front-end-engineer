	- Write down a list of the top five goals you have for your life. For each of those, ask yourself which you’d prefer:
	- You’ve accomplished the goal. BUT, you can’t tell anyone and nobody around you would know you did it. (i.e. you lost weight, but nobody around you realizes it and still thinks you’re the same as before)
	  You didn’t reach the goal. BUT, everyone around you acts as if you did. (i.e. you didn’t lose weight, but everyone thinks you’ve slimmed down and gotten into great shape.)
	  If you’re not sure, you might want to put a weight on the value of each of these goals (i.e. 50% actually doing it, vs 50% appearing like I did). Goals done for appearances risk social desirability bias.
