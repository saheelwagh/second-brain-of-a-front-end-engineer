		- I think as a coder and especially as a Project Manager, well and most of all as your friend, it is my responsibility to help you get rid of this kind of ***“stinking thinking”***, yes now we have a term for it in the English language, *“****the human tendency to persistently engage with thoughts that do not serve us”,***
		- So the first problem with this kind of thinking is, *lack of patience*, as this “3-month” time period is nothing! One should not even think that they can be productive as a web developer or as any other tech employee when they know nothing about the company, its culture, or its infrastructure, let alone the product they are trying to build or the service they are designing. *At least this is exactly what your company thinks and is prepared for.*
		- This brings me to another issue, setting *unrealistic expectations* from oneself which gives birth to the *“quitter mentality”*
		- what employers wasnt to see
			- They want to see your work ethic. How motivated are you to do a job? Not how fast you can do it!
			- How willing are you to learn? Do you ask enough questions? Do you well understand your tasks and clarify them if and when needed before jumping onto them?
			- Eventually when you start to understand things and get the hang of the work environment, how willing are you to participate in discussions? By either asking analytical questions or providing your opinions on things when needed or to even proposing a solution or uncovering the risks associated with a solution. It’s all about participation!
		- Now, my next problem is a mistake that I’ve time and again felt many people are guilty of indulging in*(including myself)*, consciously or subconsciously, *underestimating the field of Project Management.*
			- Project Management is very misunderstood in the sense that it’s not an escape for you if you are bad at coding, or if you “think” you are bad at coding. It is NOT easy, or let's say it’s not as easy as some people think!
			- *That’s because I hated coding so much, or at least I thought I hated coding!* *However, the truth was that I never tried enough to actually know or understand what it was like.*

	- how increased salary in 5 years
		- Here are the key factors that, over the past five years, have enabled me to achieve this.
		- Prepare for interviews ==diligently==
		- Change jobs frequently
			- I advise you to switch jobs at least once every two to three years. Especially when you are first starting out in your job. This has several benefits, including:
		- Learn from rejections
		- Take higher responsibilities
		- Keep learning new technologies

		- ### The Journey of a Junior IC
			- She delivers high quality work and begins building trust among her teammates. Over time, she receives additional meeting invitations from project stakeholders. Her manager asks her to work on problems of wider scope and greater ambiguity.
			- A shift begins. Instead of being handed well-defined and tightly-scoped tasks, she is asked to write design documents outlining problem areas and possible solutions. Gradually, her time spent coding decreases from 90 to 80 to 70%. She is no longer green.

			- A shift begins. Instead of being handed well-defined and tightly-scoped tasks, she is asked to write design documents outlining problem areas and possible solutions. Gradually, her time spent coding decreases from 90 to 80 to 70%. She is no longer green.
		- Although she still loves to code, she is gradually working less in VSCode and more in Google docs. This anecdote, for better or for worse, is the trajectory of many programmers such as myself. As I gain experience, my performance is measured less in lines of code and more on my ability to manage large projects, influence the team’s technical direction, and mentor others.
		- Juniors: don’t skimp on this step. While it’s tempting to dive straight into the code, sometimes we need to slow down to move fast. Or, in other words, “Two weeks of coding can save you two hours of planning.”

		- Give the newcomers or juniors opportunities to learn with your guidance. ==Create well-defined and well-scoped tasks with minimal ambiguity at first that can increase over tim==
		- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)’s recent success is causing programmers to once again [speculate about if and when they’ll be replaced by AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04383-z). However, we programmers are already replacing ourselves via the software career development cycle. With each new job level, an IC steps further from the code editor and closer to more conference rooms.
