		- If I know how you spend your time,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúthen I know what might become of you.‚Äù
		- Who do you want to be tomorrow ?
		  collapsed:: true
			- Either way, the best way to draw up a draft of who you want to be is to home in on the characteristics you want to embody‚Äîalso known as¬†[your values](https://www.nirandfar.com/common-values/).
			- According to Russ Harris, author of¬†[*The Happiness Trap*](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Trap-Second-Struggling-Living/dp/B0BSNWQ6RJ/?tag=thekerne-20), values are ‚Äúhow we want to be, what we want to stand for, and how we want to relate to the world around us.‚Äù People¬†[make time for what they want](https://www.nirandfar.com/people-make-time-for-what-they-want/). For example, one of my values is to be a caring, fun, and involved father to my daughter.
			  collapsed:: true
				- These values then act as a roadmap to becoming your ideal future self. You can use them to guide you toward the activities that help you fulfill those values.
				  collapsed:: true
					- To support my value of being the father I want to be, I created a system with my daughter: Every week, we randomly select from a jar containing pieces of paper with a fun activity scribbled on each, and then we do that activity.
				- Let‚Äôs say you want to be an author. Unless you‚Äôre spending¬†[time writing regularly](https://www.nirandfar.com/writing-to-learn/), it‚Äôs all but guaranteed that you won‚Äôt publish much. You have to make time for it or it won‚Äôt happen.
				-
		- Dedicate time to future self
			- They let outside influences like¬†[external triggers](https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-stay-on-schedule/)¬†bulldoze how they intended to spend their time or allow¬†[internal triggers](https://www.nirandfar.com/internal-triggers/)¬†to drive them to distraction.
			- But here‚Äôs the thing: Your life in the future isn‚Äôt going to look the way you want it to unless you take control of your time and attention.
			- [Timeboxing](https://www.nirandfar.com/timeboxing/), a well-studied time and attention management technique, facilitates that. It involves reserving specific periods in your calendar for traction, the activities you planned to do in advance to live out your values.
			- Unlike checking something off a¬†[to-do list](https://www.nirandfar.com/todo-vs-schedule-builder/), using a timeboxed calendar enables us to learn how long different tasks take us. That, in turn, informs a feedback loop for our progress.
			- So, if you have a goal to write a book, putting that on a to-do list is a recipe for never getting it done. But if you timebox 30 minutes a day for writing, you can track how much progress you make in that time and do some simple math to get an estimate of when you might complete the first draft.
				- Once you‚Äôve realized that you generally write 200 words in an hour, for example, you can calculate that it would take you about 200 hours to write a 40,000-word manuscript.
				- That‚Äôs actually not much considering the average American spends nearly¬†[five hours per day watching videos](https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2022/nielsens-state-of-play-report-reveals-that-streaming-is-the-future-but-consumers-are-currently-overwhelmed-by-choice/#:~:text=Of%20the%204%20hours%2C%2049,through%20connected%20TV%20(CTV).)!

	  collapsed:: true
		- The creator economy is a decentralized society where people can learn, teach, and create a better life for themselves.
		- In the creator economy you
		  collapsed:: true
			- Find people with shared goals
			- Curate your own community
			- Provide value to that community
			- Get paid for your contributions
		- My recommendation is to start with what we‚Äôve learned in previous letters.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Start an education business by pursuing your purpose (because it has minimal startup costs and huge profit margins).
			- Create an independent income for yourself.
			- Then, build a business that you¬†*really*¬†want to build.
		- I am now writing a book, building software, and strategizing the true impact I want to leave on the world. I have the money and resources to do it, but only because I started with what was available to me.
		  collapsed:: true
			- I didn‚Äôt fantasize about building a billion-dollar company just to leave me paralyzed with overwhelm and anxiety.
		- Solve your problems for profit and purpose
		  collapsed:: true
			- When you are the niche, saturation and competition cease to exist.
			- Process
				- Identify a problem in your life
				- Set a goal to reveal your present purpose
				- Experiment with different solutions
				- Find what works and create your own
				- Talk about your journey in public
				- Offer your solution with a price tag on it
			-
		- Ever since I can remember I‚Äôve always had a project to build.
		  collapsed:: true
			- A project is an organized way for achieving your goal (or purpose).
				- I watched YouTube videos, purchased supplements, and ordered a few different planners and journals.
				- I was adamant on solving the problem, so I experimented with every piece of advice I got.
				- After a few months, I had gotten some incredible results.
					- So, I sat down to create a sustainable productivity solution that would fit¬†*me*¬†to perfection (because there was always one minor issue with the other methods I tried).
				- This is when I designed and launched the digital Power Planner.
				- I didn‚Äôt have many followers at the time, but I loved the thought of making a living from my productivity knowledge. So, I:
					- Wrote content on what I knew about productivity
					- Grew a following with the proper strategies
					- Promoted the digital planner as a free download
					- Added educational resources to the free download
				- I solved my career problems by learning web design (so I built a course).
				- I solved my money problems by succeeding with freelancing (so I built another course).

		- How to start
			- profitable interests
			  collapsed:: true
				- You need a vision, goals, and priority tasks that you can execute on every single day.
				- This is how you gain knowledge, skill, and the direction to acquire both that you can pass down to those on the same path.
				- All burning problems (in your life and others) fall within the eternal markets: Health, wealth, and relationships.
				- Business is about providing a solution to problems in those domains. Simply By
					- Setting a purposeful goal to improve yourself
					- Self-educating and acquiring the skills for your mind, body, and business
					- Letting your curiosity guide which methods you choose and create
				- Curiosity is a crucial touchpoint there.

			- Project to product
			  collapsed:: true
				- You document every single one of your lifts.
				- If you aren‚Äôt seeing progress, you research and find the gaps in your knowledge.
				- you experiment with it and note the results.
				- Others may sell a weight training program to business bros that want to get jacked with only 3 days in the gym. That way they have both money and muscles so they can live a fun life. Who wouldn‚Äôt buy that (if they resonate with the product‚Äôs philosophy)?
				- My writing product,¬†[2 Hour Writer](https://2hourwriter.com/), is my unique experience with personal branding and gaining millions of followers through digital writing.
				- I experimented with idea generation, newsletter writing, and social media content over the course of 2-3 years.
				- The benefits you reap from living with purpose are your marketing firepower to help people live better lives.
				- That is, the underlying philosophy you forge through self-experimentation is how you generate a creative income from your pursuits.
			- Personal distribution center
				- My favorite way to do this is by building a personal brand.
					- rands, companies, and employers alike are hiring based on your public resume (your profile).
					- You can pivot as your life does and sell anything you want ([as long as you don‚Äôt box yourself into one narrow niche](https://thedankoe.com/the-most-profitable-niche-is-you-how-to-create-your-niche/)).
				- Build a personal distribution center by:
					- Passing down the lessons you learn pursuing your goals
					- Writing out your thoughts, beliefs, and opinions to separate yourself from others
					- Teaching what you learn in a persuasive manner

	- [be a finisher](https://dariusforoux.com/finisher/)
		- One of the things I realized early on in my life is that education is not so much about what you learn (unless you want to be a lawyer, doctor, or in other specialized professions).
		- Education is about showing yourself and the world that you have the ability to¬†[finish what you start](https://dariusforoux.com/beat-procrastination/).
		- We tend to make life more complicated than it is. We assume we need the perfect degree, live in the right place, and get the best job, otherwise, we can‚Äôt succeed.
		- But this mentality will only set you up for failure. Regardless of a person‚Äôs ability, I think everyone can improve their life if they become someone who cares more about finishing than about starting the perfect thing.
		- mindset
			- **Perseverance**: Never give up because your goal is too hard. Don‚Äôt make your life harder by complaining about how hard things are.
			- **Mindfulness**: Always be in the present moment and avoid overthinking. The moment you start thinking about the future and why you‚Äôre doing what you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôre lost. Too much thinking will drive you nuts. Analysis paralysis doesn‚Äôt help.
			- **Balance**: Never over-extend yourself to a point where you burn out. Work hard, but not too hard.
			- **Planning**: Create a perfectly thought-out plan that tells you what to do every day, week, and month. Also, think about what your ideal end result would look like.
			- **Execution**: To finish what you start, you need to be switched on every single day. You can‚Äôt waste your time. You
