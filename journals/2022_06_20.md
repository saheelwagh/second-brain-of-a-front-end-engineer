- map js adv concepts course to rust
- [[async js]]
	- advanced js course
	- revisit web api web callback events
		- when fn is of webapi -> send it to webapi and then web api does something for us and returns result
	- async ->> we dont have the data right now
	- How js works
	  collapsed:: true
		- what is a program
			- allocat mem
			- parse and execute
		- ks engine
			- mem heap
				- mem leak -> unused vars fill up heap
			- call stack ->? whjere code is read and executed
				- remove and place as methods are called
		- js is single threaded -> one call stack only lifo
			- why ? -> easy as deadlocks not there
		- sync -> one fn runs after other
			- what if one task is too big job ?
		- webapi -> pops out of call stack till result to be returned to call stack
			- added to callback queue
		- event loop
			-
	- Javascript promises
	  collapsed:: true
		- an obj that may produce a value in the future
			- resolved
			- rejected or
			- third type
		- when good -> for making api calls
		- promise.all
	- async await
		- built on top of promises
		- .catch ? -> try catch block -> rewatch this part
		-
- prepare pm theory for sagar or other suitable candiates
