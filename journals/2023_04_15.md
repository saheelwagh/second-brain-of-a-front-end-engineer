	- [Career Sampling](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/career-sampling?utm_source=pocket_saves)
	  collapsed:: true
		- I deployed my first set of four smart contracts last weekend, and it’s some of the most fun I’ve ever had with work. This is the first time in a while I’ve felt pulled to working 10-12 hour days. Not because of financial stress or urgency, but because I’m having so much damn fun with it.
		- think the goal of any career search is to find a sufficiently lucrative infinite game you could keep playing indefinitely.
		- The goal of high-speed career sampling is **not** to get a bunch of jobs. It’s to do a bunch of different forms of work. You can do types of work without permission or anyone giving you a job. And you should probably try on the type of work before you take on a 2-4 year job.
			- Basically you want to find a type of work that you enjoy doing, that pulls you in deeper, and that you’d keep doing for minimal compensation. If it happens to also pay a lot, great, but you should enjoy it even if it doesn’t.
		- finer points
			- when to quit
				- Psychedelics help. Or just when the work feels like a chore.
			- how to fund this
				- If you’re in your 20s, don’t get overly swayed by the “magic of compounding interest.” It’s only magical if you make basically the same amount for the rest of your life. If you’re reading articles like this though you’re probably gonna do pretty well for yourself and make way more money later, so stop trying to be so responsible with it right now. Spend it on finding that work and worry about saving up later.
			- commitment ?
				- I agree, but you have to commit to the right things. You should probably spend at least 10-20% of the time you’ll eventually spend on something deciding if you want to spend that time on it. So for a 10 year career, that’s a year of testing it. Lifetime of marriage, 3-4 years of testing. Don’t be embarrassed if you try something for a year and quit it. You just saved yourself a decade of unhappiness.
				- hat’s not the point. You’ll get good at anything you commit to. Most of talent is bullshit. Don’t worry about getting good, worry about seeing if you *like the process of getting good*. If you’re only going to enjoy something when you’re good at it, you’re not going to stick with it. You’re looking for what you also enjoy sucking at.

		- define
		  collapsed:: true
			- Until you've defined exactly what goes into the process you're trying to build a system for, you can't systematize it. Just because you’ve done something over and over again doesn’t mean you fully understand each of the steps that go into it, or that you can explain them well to someone else.
			- I learned this at [Growth Machine](http://www.growthmachine.com/) when we started hiring more people. We were getting some of the same questions over and over again, which told us we hadn't done a good job of clarifying how to do the work we were hiring people to do.
				- So we went through every role at the company and created standard operating procedures to explain how to do every single thing that someone might have to do more than once.
				- This created a massive library of SOPs in our shared [Notion database](http://www.nateliason.com/notion) explaining how to do things like hire a freelance writer, pay an invoice, upload articles, and much more so that no one needed to explain how to do things anymore.

They’re also the things I think I’ll be unlikely to do if I don’t set a specific goal for them. I’ll always pull them from my annual goals and their next steps, to make sure that I’m staying on track for the bigger goals I’m aiming towards.
				- I have two sets of weekly goals: the goals that I want to do every single week (publish article, finish book, publish notes), and the Week X goals, the goals specific to that week.

		- organizing the week
		  collapsed:: true
			- My week is designed to maximize the amount of time I can spend on offense, working on what will produce the most meaningful results for me and my businesses
			- That means I maximize my unscheduled time so I can work for long periods on wherever the intersection is between what I think will be the most valuable work to do, and what I feel like doing.
			- very few meetas and lots of unsched time
				- ![](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:format(jpg):extract_focal()/https%3A%2F%2Fuploads-ssl.webflow.com%2F5ad143610f7efd77b6f188f3%2F5b89987e4de076d08f99fe1b_pasted%2520image%25200%2520(3).png)
			- **I also don’t try to schedule what I’ll work on when. If I want to spend four hours on a post like this one, I don’t want to feel bad for it. The work will get done, and I’d rather follow my energy than try to stick to a rigid schedule.**
			- The only other important thing I’ll try to do in my weekly planning is to frontload the weekly goals. If I can bang them out in Monday to Wednesday, that gives me Thursday and Friday to get ahead of where I was aiming for.
			- But the week isn’t really where the organizing magic comes in, that’s at the daily level.
		- organizing the day
		  collapsed:: true
			- All of my day-to-day execution lives in [Asana](http://asana.com/). I’ve used [Trello](http://trello.com/) and other tools before, but Asana gives me the best mix of organizational styles, especially for all of the work we do at Growth Machine.
			- In the “My Tasks” view, I’ll have a list of everything that would ideally get done today, and then I’ll split it out by “Top Priority” and “Good to Do”:
			- The top priority tasks are, you guessed it, the daily goals in the spreadsheet. Copying them over here lets me just look at the spreadsheet once a day, and then execute in Asana for the rest of the day.
			- As much as possible, **I will not do *anything* in the Good to Do until the Top Priority tasks are done**. Sometimes there’ll be a fire, or something really quick, but as much as possible I’ll avoid the less important tasks in favor of the three that I chose as the most important.
			- There are only two other fixed parts of the day: I’ll read for around an hour right when I wake up, and I’ll go to the gym around 4pm. I read right when I wake up because I know if I don’t do it then, it’s unlikely to get done later, and I go to the gym around 4 since it’s much less busy, and I’ll have more time to do work after the gym and before dinner.
			-
		- staying productive during the day
		  collapsed:: true
			- the more I’ve refined the process, the less and less important I think most of this is. If you have well organized goals you care about, you’ll get them done. You won’t need to do silly things like the pomodoro technique, you’ll just do the work.
			- quiet hours for deep work
			  collapsed:: true
				- At Growth Machine, we only expect each other to be rapidly responsive between 12 and 4pm EST. That means for the rest of the day, we can do deep work on the important stuff and get less distracted by constantly responding to messages.
				- I’ll wake up and read and have my coffee / tea and usually start work around 8, which gives me four hours of completely uninterrupted focus to get my most important work done. I also (almost) never schedule a meeting before noon, so I can be sure that I’ll get at least a few hours of [Deep Work](https://www.nateliason.com/lessons/deep-work-cal-newport/) in each morning.

			- Information processing
			  collapsed:: true
				- If someone sends me an article, or I see something on Twitter, or I want to Google something, I’ll save that page to Instapaper to look at it later. Then when I feel like reading articles, I’ll open Instapaper and scroll through all of the options I have available, archive most of them, and read the ones that look the most interesting in the context of all the other options I have.

					- All I do for this is take my weekly goals and work in progress in Asana, see what would have the biggest impact if it got done tomorrow, set those as the three goals in the spreadsheet, and add them in Asana in the “Top Priority” section so they’re there in the morning.

			- ## Summary Notes
			  
			  Only one profession has developed a comprehensive philosophy on *how to work*, the culinary arts, and that philosophy is *mise-en-place,* a French phrase which means “to put in place.” In the kitchen, it means to gather and arrange the ingredients and tools needed for cooking, but it’s also a tradition of focus and discipline, a method of working and being. A way of life. [vii].
			  
			  There is a difference between working hard and working *clean*. [viii]
			- ### Focus: How mise-en-place works
			  
			  Part of developing good MEP is having a plan of how everything will happen, and a map of where everything should be.
			  
			  You should know where all of your tools are blindfolded.
			  
			  When you stir something, you cool it, and it takes longer to cook.
			  
			  Chef simply means “boss” in French.
			- ### Chaos: How we work without MIP
			  
			  A big part of our overwhelm with work occurs because we’ve never been taught how to manage that work.
			  
			  “The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent” – Eisenhower
			  
			  Chefs commit to a life of preparation, where you always have to think ahead. Cooking can’t happen without prep coming first.
			  
			  A commitment to process doesn’t mean following tedious procedures, it’s about becoming a high-functioning human being and being happier for it. Good process must not only make the work better but make you better. Excellence arises from refining good process—how can I do this better, or easier, or with less waste? It’s a job, like preparation, that never ends.
			- ### Ingredient 1: Planning is Prime
			  
			  Why not wake up a half hour earlier? Isn’t creating your day better than fighting it? Why not prepare as much as you can the night before so you’re not running around like a maniac the next morning?
			  
			  Making a list of things to do isn’t enough, you also have to square it with the clock. How long will all of these things take? How much can I actually get done given my time resources? What order will I do them in?
			  
			  We need to work clean with time, which means:
			- Determining our daily actions
			- Ordering those actions in sequence
			  
			  For your most important, recurring tasks, log out how long they take so you can make accurate predictions of how long they’ll take in the future. Such as writing an article or preparing an email report.
			  
			  Figure out your Meeze Point, the optimal number of actions you can put in your daily list before you begin to overload yourself.
			- Select 3 actions to complete for this day.
			- Plan those actions on your calendar
			- If you truly commit those tasks when and as quickly as you planned, you can up to 4 tasks tomorrow
			- Keep increasing until you start to fail at completing your tasks. That’s your meeze point.
			  
			  Arrive everywhere 15 minutes early so you never feel rushed or stressed.
			  
			  **Recipe for success**: Commit to being honest with time. Plan daily. [60]
			- ### Ingredient 2: Arranging Spaces, Perfecting Movements
			  
			  You don’t need much space if you’re smart about how you use it.
			  
			  Cultivate the use of both sides of your body, both sides of the space, both sides of a motion.
			  
			  Create checklists so you have recurring recipes for your processes [79]
			- Select a task that you do often
			- Break it down into 10 steps or fewer
			- Determine if you need a Read-Do (read then do it) or a Do-Confirm (do the items then use the checklist after to confirm)
			- Test your checklist by using it 3 times
			- Update the checklist each time you use it, as necessary
			  
			  **Recipe for success:** Commit to setting your station and reducing impediments to your movements and activities. Remove friction.
			- ### Ingredient 3: Cleaning as You Go
			  
			  You cook the way you look: the cleaner your station, the faster you work.
			  
			  Practice “coming to zero”: every hour, take a minute to straighten your physical and digital workspace, no matter what you’re currently doing.
			  
			  Try “knolling”:
			- Scan your environment for anything not in use
			- Put away everything not in use
			- Group all “like” objects
			- Align or square all objects to either the surface they’re on, or the studio itself
			  
			  **Recipe for success**: Commit to maintaining your system. Always be cleaning.
			- ### Ingredient 4: Making First Moves
			  
			  The first moments cost more than the later ones.
			  
			  When a task in the present unlocks a cascade of work that other people do on our behalf, the worth of process time increases and becomes harder to measure.
			  
			  There are two kinds of work. The first is hands on, immersive, and creative, like writing or designing. This is solo, creative work that is usually your most important work. But there is also hands off, process work that enables other people to do work. This seems less important, since it’s more managerial, but since it enables other people to do their work it’s worth doing first.
			  
			  Begin each day with 30 minutes of scheduled process time, starting, unlocking, and unblocking the work of others [112].
			  
			  **Recipe for your success:** Commit to using time to your benefit. Start now. [115]
			- ### Ingredient 5: Finishing Actions
			  
			  Do similar jobs at the same time to minimize the switching costs between actions.
			  
			  Avoid orphaned tasks: tasks that haven’t been tied up in the neatest way possible to enable easy continuation later.
			  
			  If you can’t finish a task, tie it up for later. Collect all the materials and keep them in one place till you resume. Jot down any thoughts you have that are at the top of your mind that you want to remember. Schedule your session to resume the work. Communicate your progress to a partner or stakeholders to assess what remains to be done and whether help is available.
			  
			  Record all of your breaks during an immersive work section to see where you lose the most time, and to be more strategic about how and when you take breaks.
			  
			  **Recipe for success:** Commit to delivering. When a task is nearly done, finish it. Always be unblocking. [134]
			- ### Ingredient 6: Slowing Down to Speed Up
			  
			  “Sometimes, it’s the panic about work that’s in your way, not the work itself.” [139]
			  
			  When you hear yourself overtalking or interrupting someone, simply talk slower. It’ll have a calming effect on you and force the other person to pay attention.
			  
			  Instead of stopping when you feel distracted, just move very slowly.
			  
			  In times of stress or panic, clean your work station so your visual field is clear. Think about what you need to do next. Batch your tasks together. Close apps. Get to zero. Now resume slowly. [147]
			  
			  **Recipe for success**: Commit to working smoothly and steadily. Use physical order to restore mental order. Don’t rush.
			- ### Ingredient 7: Open Eyes and Ears
			  
			  **Recipe for success**: Commit to balancing external and internal awareness. Stay alert. [163]
			- Ingredient 8: Call and Callback
			- Being polite can get in the way of getting work done, you need to communicate efficiently.
	- [how to take smart notes](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/smart-notes?utm_source=pocket_saves)
		- The core idea of Smart Notes is that purely extracting highlights is generally a waste of time. A highlight speaks to you when you take it, but if you don't capture the idea that the highlight gave you, you're unlikely to remember the importance of that highlight later. Or even if you do feel some spark when revisiting the highlight, it might be a different interpretation.
		- You want to create notes that are relevant to contexts important to you, not just related to the book you read.
		- Steps
			- take physical notes as you read
			- record bibliographical srces
			- upload
