- never let a crisis go waste -> cult fit
  collapsed:: true
	- In 2016, Mukesh Bansal and Ankit Nagori founded cure.fit (now rebranded as cult.fit)
	- it wasn't until early 2020, when the company was whacked by the pandemic and realized the true potential of the tech it had and the inherent risks associated with running its own offline fitness centres across cities
	- The company had to shut down most of its centres or make them semi-operational due to the heavy fixed costs like rent and maintenance involved in running its own gyms. It also had to lay off over 1500 employees
	- With its existing tech infrastructure and being a digital-first company, cult.fit decided to pounce on this golden opportunity to launch digital fitness content.
	- *"All of our customer interactions were through the app even in the offline world. They will buy online, book classes online, manage their health statistics on the app so we had tonnes of content already on the app for fitness, mediation etc. Our telemedicine offering was also there. It was a matter of repackaging and enhancing it a bit and changing the app orientation to be digital first but lot of the building blocks were already there. That certainly helped us to move very fast and pivot,"* said Mukesh Bansal in an interview with Entrepreneur.
	- In a bid to turn profitable, the company has acquired F2 Fun and Fitness, the Indian franchise owner of Gold's Gym.
	- This allows cult.fit to have Gold's Gym centres as a part of its primary Cult Pass offering — which allows pass holders access to high-quality gyms across the country, along with the company's digital content and offline classes.
	- **But why is cult.fit deciding to go big on partnering with existing gyms than building its own offline gym network?**
		- **n business, vertical integration is when a company decides to own the entire value chain.** For a company like Apple, it would mean designing and fabricating its own hardware, software, product/service delivery and customer service.
		- For vertical integration, a business might have to take on significant debt. And taking on such debt only makes sense when the business is building an infrastructural moat that will keep new players from coming in. The telecom and power industry are great examples of businesses where it makes sense to take up a lot of debt upfront to invest in building an infrastructural moat. The company's future earnings should allow it to repay this debt back or the investment simply will not make sense.
		- **In contrast, focusing on core competencies and outsourcing everything else in the value chain makes sense when the risks in vertical integration far outweigh the benefits.**
		- With owning gyms, the company has to constantly haggle with landlords and work on reducing rents, which are fixed costs, independent of the footfall or the revenues the company is earning from that location. Also, the service staff operating these gyms acts like a major cost center for the company, which are again, fixed operating costs.

	- there isn’t much information in regards to short-term productivity. As software engineers, short-term productivity is as important, if not more important than long-term productivity. Because if you think of it, the actual work — coding, designing or whatever that may be — gets done in blocks of a few hours every single day
	- day. This is when you need to have a clear mind and a natural rhythm, where your knowledge, motivations, and concentration all perfectly align. In the world of productivity systems, this is called the “flow-state”.
	- Flow state is equally important when programming, as we often maintain a lot of details in our mind at any given time. For example: What code path is the data flow taking? What values do variables hold, how are they changing as the code path progresses? Where are the breakpoints? How does the data structure, say a tree, visually look like at any given moment? Where exactly in the recursion stack are you? What does the overall design look like?
	- Sure, there are IDEs and tools to help you track that, but the most effective and productive software engineers can juggle this information in their short-term memory, creating a deep level of immersion, or flow-state, that makes them incredibly productive. But as amazing as this flow-state is, it is also all too easy to break out of with very simple distractions, which can completely kill the flow-state. I am sure you have all experienced times when you are in the middle of debugging something and you have 17 things juggling in your mind, you are about to figure the issue out, and someone comes and asks you a question. And then you have to start, all over again because you’ve lost the state you were in. Well, that’s what distractions do.
	- 5 steps
	  collapsed:: true
		- eliminate ext distractions
		- internal
			- get rid of the distractions of chat, notifications, social media updates and whatever it is that gives you a quick dopamine hit
			- Even with apps that help you improve your productivity, like the calendar for example, there is a balance between using those tools to get your job done vs over-utilization, that can create too much noise.
		- ensure that task is decomposed and specific
		- find your bio peak time
		- make sure task in Goldilocks zone
		  collapsed:: true
			- In order to reach flow state, you will need to be happy, confident, alert and focused. Having a well-defined task gives you the confidence in your ability to complete it. Working on an exciting feature keeps you happy. The right amount of challenge keeps you alert and getting rid of the distractions results in your being focused.
				- ork doesn’t come in a form that allows you to be happy, confident, alert and focused. It is often ambiguous, vague, too challenging and not motivating enough. It is up to you to break it down and do all the leg work to transform it into something that allows you to get into flow state.
					- onsider being fit, for example. If your goal is to participate in a triathlon next year, that goal as a whole is too vague and challenging to work on. You will need to break it down to simple components. Then perhaps gamify each task by tracking your progress, competing with friends or giving yourself timely rewards so that each sub-task is exciting enough. After that, you will need to ensure you work on this on your biological peak time and do your best to remove internal and external distractions when you work on it.
