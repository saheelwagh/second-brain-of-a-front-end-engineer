	  the tide didn't start turning inmy favor until I reached for a betterweapon a weapon that in truth it'salways hard to wield but it's also aweapon that the biological you ishelpless to stand against if you canMaster it that weapon is disciplined
	  
	  number one treat
	  
	  every decision as though it's important
	  
	  Maslow had another framework which Ifound vastly more helpful in my own lifeI call it the plus one framework ofdecision making
	  
	  imagine you're standing in the middle ofa road that stretches in both directionsto The Horizon
	  
	  signs spaced to equal intervalsand they all say plus one plus one plusone behind you stretching off into theopposite direction the signs all saynegative one negative one negative one
	  
	  hese signs each represent a singledecision and with that decision you caneither make the plus one decision thatmoves you forward in Life or you canmake the negative one decision thatmoves you back
	  
	  does not matter howimportant the decision is each decisionis an opportunity to either move forwardor backwards one sign at a time that's
	  
	  soif you treat every small decision suchas whether or not you should drink wateror get that soda or whether you shouldgo for a run or stay on the couchwhether you should fold your laundry andhow much just watch Netflix if you canwin those small battles and consistently
	  
	  make the decisions that move you forwardin life then you will have incrediblemomentum which you can carry forwardinto the really big decisions in life
	  
	  the moral of the story is this startsmall and treat every decision as thoughit were moving you towards or away fromyour greatness
	  
	  number twoyou don't have to love it do it anyway
	  
	  the universe doesnot care how you feel it cares aboutwhat you do
	  
	  which is good because mostof us never feel like doing the hardthing so I encourage you to act inaccordance with your thoughts not yourfeelings the trick to achievingincredible results is to always takeaction in spite of how you feel
	  
	  numberthree remove Temptations
	  
	  partfour become the master and the slave
	  
	  the strategy was twofold the first partis to imagine that I'm two people thereis current me and there is future mecurrent Anthony's job is to tell futureAnthony what to do and when to do it hedoes this by utilizing a tool calledtime blocking
	  
	  I schedule each task on thecalendar from this place of emotional
	  
	  Detachment because current me knows Idon't have to do the work because ofthat I don't get emotional I can lay itout with logic what activities future meshould do to move us towards ourCollective greatness
	  
	  because often in the moment our thoughtsare clouded by emotions
	  
	  uture Anthonydoesn't worry about how he feels in themoment he just looks at the calendarsees what past Anthony assigned for himand then he just does the work and thisis how you live a life by Desig
	  
	  part five identifyyour why
	  
	  finally thelast step of creating discipline is todevelop a daily disciplined practice
	  
	  disciplines and muscle
	  
	  bydeveloping a daily discipline practicesomething like taking cold showers orforcing yourself to sit down and writeor go for a run simply put makingyourself do the hard thing
	  
	  let'sfigure out how to apply it towards oneof the biggest weapons that theresistance is going to useprocrastination here's how to win thebattle against procrastination in sixsimple steps listen you're now armed andready with one of the most powerfulweapons in the universe discipline butthe truth is the biological you issneaky and he has ways of getting youoff track without you even realizing itand discipline doesn't do you any goodif you aren't aware of when you need toactually use it now the most commonstruggle
	  
	  it's one that many of you can connectwith is the battle againstprocrastination so here's my simple sixstep process for overcomingprocrastination step one become awarethat you're delaying and this Step Oneis obvious you can't solve a problem ifyou aren't aware that you have a problemright so often we get sucked down inthese rabbit holes of social media orjust some other glitzy distraction noteven realizing it the key then is youneed to build pattern interrupts intoyour dead the one that I'm fond of issomething that I call intentionmaintenance simply put I set an alarm to
	  
	  go off on my phone randomly throughoutthe day and when that alarm goes offit's accompanied with the questionwhat's my outcome and this is a reallyimportant question because it pulls meout of the moment like whatever I'mworking on and it gives me anopportunity to reflect what am I doingin that moment and if I keep doing it isit going to move me towards my greatnessor away from it is this a plus onedecision or a negative one and you'd besurprised a lot of times that alarm'sgoing to go off it's going to catch youin the middle of Doom scrolling Facebookor something else equally stupid butthat's a good thing because now you're
	  
	  aware you are slipping which means wecan move to the next step which is toreclaim your intention once you becomeaware that you're distracted or you'reprocrastinating you need to reclaim yourintention or put another way you have toin that moment reconnect with why youshould be doing the thing that you'reputting off once you do that it's timeto move to the next step which isdefining your objective listen you can'twin the game if you don't know the rulesso the next step is you have to getclear about what you need to do in thatnext moment to start moving towards yourgoal what does it look like to actually
	  
	  win the game it's so surprising to mehow very few people actually take thetime to do this but I think you'll besurprised to discover just how powerfulit is once you get super clear on what'syour objective and then you're gonna seta tiny goal see Massive Action oftenleads to massive failure because we getoverwhelmed and just give up insteadyour only goal is to get little bit oftraction and translate that into forwardmomentum because remember this law ofmotion an object at rest tends to stayat rest and an object in motion tends tostay in motion so to do this we start bysetting a tiny goal which is what's the
	  
	  smallest amount of meaningful action youcould take to get the ball rolling rightnow you're going to set that goal andthen you're going to start a timer nowParkinson's law says that the scope ofwork will expand to fill the timeallotted operating without cleardeadlines is a great way to ensure atask never gets completed so to reallyboost your productivity stop givingyourself so much time to complete tasksshortening the time window is a greatway of increasing the output so insteadof saying I'm going to complete this bythe end of the week start saying I willcomplete this by the end of day or even
	  
	  better by the end of the hour and thenfinally the last step in overcomingprocrastination and I know this one'sstupid simple is just get started as theGerman philosopher Gutta said whateveryou can do or dream you can begin itboldness has a genius magic and Power init begin it now listen momentum is thecure to procrastination it doesn't evenhave to be a lot of momentum any littlebit of Forward Motion is enough to putinertia and Sir Isaac Newton on yourside so start small get traction don't
	  
	  stop it's that simple that's how youovercome procrastination and now listendon't make the mistake of thinking thisis going to be easy because it's not thebiological you is a powerful Foe and islikely you're going to lose a lot ofbattles against this other you andthat's okay the goal isn't to be perfectis to make progress so every day is anopportunity to show up and continuedeveloping this most important skillwhich is discipline and if you do thison a long enough time frame there'sliterally nothing you can't achieve hey
