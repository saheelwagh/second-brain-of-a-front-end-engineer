	  I want youto make it an old mistake literally oldmistake o l d
	  
	  O stands for own ityou want to own
	  
	  I want you to think about these four A'sfirst AI is accountable when you want toOwn It it means you're going to takeresponsibility for it remember this withgreat responsibility comes great powerwhen you take responsibility forsomething it gives you great power tomake things better so you start withaccountability the second a is you haveto accept it part of accepting it isforgiveness forgiveness of others
	  
	  forgiveness of yourself
	  
	  the research in the areaof self-compassion showed those whoforgave themselves follow through moreoften so treat yourself with love andyou're going to be more successful notless when you beat yourself up andyou're hard on yourself you're lesslikely to follow through so acknowledgethat you're human that you make mistakes
	  
	  third a is apologize if you need toapologize to others because of your goofdo it do it swiftly do it brieflyapologize and tell them that you'reworking on the situation saying sorryremember this it takes courage but it'sfar better to come clean than to hideyour error or Worse to blame others forit in the long run people will rememberyour integrity long after they'veforgotten about the original mistake
	  
	  the fourth a is admityou want to admit it come cleanadmitting your mistakes is not a sign ofweakness but it's a sign of maturity byembracing humility trust can be built orrebuilt both on a personal andorganizational levels admitting yourerrors also and invites other peoplearound you to admit theirs and do thesame so it contributes to creation of ahealthy environment both home and alsoat work and when you help Foster this
	  
	  authenticity even when the mistake isnot your own when people feel safeenough to admit their fault to forgiveothers for things that they've done orthat others have done then they don'trush to judgment and what's important isthat you separate the person from themistake give them a chance to explain tomake things better an admission of amistake even if it's done privately toyourself makes learning possible it saysa really good environment to help you to
	  
	  transform by moving the focus away fromblame towards a focus of understanding
	  
	  the L in Old stands for learn
	  
	  remember this often ourbest teacher is our last mistake in lifesituations tend to repeat themselves
	  
	  what Ido is I start by getting Clarity andidentifying the mistake you must firstunderstand what you did wrong in orderto change it this takes a certain levelof self-awareness
	  
	  d stands for don't repeat
	  
	  what can youdo to stop yourself from repeating thesemistakes here are six P'
	  
	  first p isyou want to prepare what does that meanpreparation is key you want to identifythe skills the knowledge the resourcesmaybe the tools that will keep you fromrepeating the error
	  
	  second p isprogress here's the thing you can'tmanage something unless you can measureit what I would recommend is you take
	  
	  notes and you chart your progress thatyou're making on this path and you canalso celebrate your progress as well
	  
	  third P are patterns when people ask mewhat genius is one of my common answersis it's pattern recognition rememberyour past mistakes think of pastSolutions one of the best ways to solvea problem or mistake is to identify howyou've solved similar problems ormistakes in the past so you can look atyour own patterns because Genius Leaves
	  
	  Clues
	  
	  you're a genius at doing thethings that you do so look at thepatterns of your behavior look at thepatterns of your thought look at thepatterns of how you've had similarissues in the past are there other timeswhen you forgot to do something writethose patterns or those themes down andnotice what keeps on coming up for youthis may help you identify a larger goalthat you need to work on maybe certainskills maybe it's your focus maybe it'syour learning maybe it's your commitmen
	  
	  fourth p is prevention you want to
	  
	  prevent future mistakes so how do you dothat if you could successfully find asolution to your mistake then you arebeginning the process of success in thefuture and avoidance and mistakes so youcan write down what you think you didwrong you could write down a goal orwhat you want to do in the future so forexample let's say that you made amistake and you didn't complete anassignment on time then make sure you
	  
	  prevent future Mistakes by using Memoryaids that we teach you in previousepisodes maybe if you haven't gone thoseepisodes you're going to use somethinglike a Post-It note and you're going toput it on your computer to remind yo
	  
	  finally thelast T is plan plan beating yourself up
	  
	  for mistakes won't help you as you gothrough this process it's important youspend the majority of your time thinkingabout how to be better tomorrow how tobe better in the future so what helpsyou to do that making a plan making aplan will help you to avoid makingsimilar mistakes be as detailed as youcan but remain flexible because you knowyour plans may change whether you findan accountability partner or you track
	  
	  your progress on a journal or on yourcalendar find a way to keep yourselfaccountable keep in mind that what worksfor somebody else might not work for you
