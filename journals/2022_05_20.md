- Vscode 2 best shortcuts
  collapsed:: true
	- The go back and go forward commands in VSCode will allow you to traverse through your cursor position’s history. In VSCode this is bound to (ctrl/alt) - and shift (ctrl/alt) - respectively by default. Personally, I always remap it to (ctrl/cmd) + [ or ] because it feels a lot more natural as these keys are the default shortcut for similar actions in other applications. For example, in most browsers, this controls your back and forward functions. You can remap these shortcuts this by navigating to preferences > keyboard shortcuts and searching for go back or go forward to remap it

	- THIS COURSE IS FOR YOU IF:
	  You want to master the fundamentals of design without spending years in design school (and don’t necessarily want to think of yourself as a designer)
	  You want to build, launch, and sell your own products and not have them look ugly
	  You have clients asking for you to add some design polish to the projects you built for them
	  You want to learn from “over-the-shoulder” walkthroughs of how designers really design
	  You want to stop feeling embarrassed when you give someone a link to your portfolio
	- HIS COURSE IS NOT FOR YOU IF:
	  You’re not willing to commit to putting into practice what the course teaches (you won’t learn just by watching the videos!)
	  You have the time to teach yourself design through trial and error (it is possible, but it’ll take longer)
	  You don’t have the motivation to start learning design just yet
	  You want to learn abstract design principles about movement, balance, rhythm …
	  You favour trends as opposed to designing for usability and conversions

	- Before moving forward, I would like to give you my introduction.
	  Hi 👋, my name is Rishi Purwar, a developer from India 🇮🇳. I'm an enthusiastic web developer who has been building side projects for quite some time now. Apart from this, I also got selected as a Google Summer Of Code Student at Postman. I'm also a 3rd-year B.Tech student pursuing Chemical Engineering at MNIT Jaipur, India.
	- [CodingSpace](https://github.com/rishipurwar1/coding-space) is an Open Source platform where we aim to provide lots of different real-world UI challenges. These challenges are designed to help you improve your web development skills and to build a great portfolio of projects.
	- I used Cloudinary to host images and files for my website, it's a cloud-based image management solution that allows me to host, manage, and serve the images and files for my website. It costs me $0 because I decided to go with their free tier which is more than enough for my project as of now.
	- I also got to know about lots of ways to improve the performance of a React App. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading are two of them. Using these techniques helps me to reduce the bundle size by splitting a large bundle of code into multiple small bundles that can be loaded dynamically, which improves the user experience. This technique helps us avoid performance issues associated with large bundles without actually reducing the amount of code in our React app.
	- Upgrading third-party dependencies or modules can be challenging. Upgrading is a process that sometimes involves rewriting some existing code to work with newer versions as per their latest syntax in order to avoid errors or improve readability. Recently, I upgraded Firebase from v7 to v9 and React Router DOM from v5 to v6 in production. You'll find more information about that in the next section
