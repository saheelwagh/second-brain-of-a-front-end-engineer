- study on storytellers
  collapsed:: true
	- learning by inversion
		- learn what works by learning what does not work by studying what does not work
	- there are 2 ways to tell a story : spontaneous and strategically
	- talented storytellers use strategic withholding
		- before begin story, decide which details to withhold
		- bad speakers lack narrative hooks
			- a hook raises  a question without immediately providing the answer
				- it was the worst date of my life
		- ngGt writes down all stories and analogies to be shared in an interview
	- when finally get to answer, they use dragging
		- like drawn out fight scene climax
	- thus not only art of satrat hiding but also time dilation
	- for vocal rhythm the most important parts are
		- speed
		- volume
		- enthu
		- staccato and rhymr
		- purposeful silence
	- most imp ingedient : blowing your own mind off
		- relive the story and its impact on you in real time
			- mirror neurons
				- When you see a fighter break their ankle, you wince. When you see someone who canâ€™t breathe from laughing, you smile.
