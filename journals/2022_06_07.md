		  collapsed:: true
			- inflation
			  collapsed:: true
				- When interest rates are high, the capital doesn’t need to take as much risk to receive payback, it can just chill at the bank. If the capital stays at the bank, startups lose their main source of income: investment. Without the hungry startups and their scale-up mindset, Product Culture as we know it receives a blow
			- metaverse and web3
				- With the decentralization of internet, the lines between customer and provider are blurred. In that same way, the metaverse blurs the line between physical and digital. We are at the threshold of a change in how we deal with… well, reality. It will be so intense that it’s impossible to predict the consequences. The only thing that is sure is that it will bring consequences.
			- everybody wants to becomne pm
				- people flock to the career in droves under promises of growth and high pays with relatively low effort. There can only be so much demand for so many people, and even worse, we are reproducing lessons from biases built on top of the original material. The updates to the craft are far slower then the expansion of the market.
				-
		- I believe we’ll settle on something in between. More demand for predictability, higher aversion to risk, less multidisciplinary teams, but shorter user feedbacks, less processes and more horizontal leadership.
		- I would definitely recommend that you broaden your horizons on the topic. People on the Product community tend to obsess over subject rather then substance some times. If you have the core values of Product Development truly at heart, changes will come and go and you’ll still be a good leader.
		- Remember to “listen” to the customer frequently (either by data or direct feedback), be sympathetic to either yours external or internal stakeholders, make more questions than answers and have the back of your teammates. This career will never end.
