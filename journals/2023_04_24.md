		- What do you really want from life? There are two options:
			- You don’t know
			- You think you know but you’re not sure
		- The problem is that most of us will never find out [what we really want](https://dariusforoux.com/yes-to-passion/).
		- As Gary Keller and Jay Papasan, authors of *[The One Thing](https://amzn.to/40Ni7MT)*, said:
			- >
			- “Success is sequential, not simultaneous.”
		- This means you can achieve a lot, just not at the same time. You achieve one thing after the other.
		- When you follow this strategy, you can accomplish way more in life than you think. Most people fail because they try to do too many things at the same time and they try to do it too fast.

		- When you set fixed goals, you create a psychological tunnel vision (not to be confused with [medical tunnel vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_vision)). So you go through life with blinders on.

		- **In science, the concept that comes close to that is called Attentional Bias.Source: [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/attentional-bias)**
		  collapsed:: true
			- For example, if someone is anxious about a potential recession, they may focus more on potential threats (like losing their job) than opportunities (finally [changing careers](https://dariusforoux.com/change-careers/)).
			- So here’s what happens. You set fixed goals and get tunnel vision caused by the attentional bias. You keep moving towards your goal even if it’s no longer the right goal.

		- flexible goals for happiness
			- Sometime in my teens, I made up the goal to “live somewhere warm.”
			  collapsed:: true
				- When I look back at it now, I honestly don’t know where it comes from. I guess it comes from pop culture. So many movies are set in sunny California. Most music also glorifies sunny places.
				- A few years ago I said, “I want to live in Spain.” Why? Because it’s warm. Okay, great.
				- w, I’m glad I didn’t make my goal 100% fixed. Because for the past years, I’ve been making all my goals flexible. So I said:
					- “I’m going to test what it’s like to live in Spain. If I don’t like it, I’ll come back.”
					- I didn’t fixate on living there despite anything. Last year I loaded up my car and drove to southern Spain, and stayed there for four months. After two months I knew it was not for me.
					- I learned I didn’t like to live in Spain at all. I simply enjoyed visiting Spain and coming back home.
				- I’m still very happy I followed through on my goal to live somewhere warm. Here are a few reasons why:
					- **If I didn’t do it, I would regret it later** — I don’t want to be that guy who later says, “Oh man, [I wish I made that move](https://dariusforoux.com/procrastination-regret/) when I was young.”
					- **I learned many new things** — When you travel, you always learn new things about yourself and about being efficient with your time and resources. Turns out I’m very patient when it comes to work and learning, but not at all when it comes to daily life.
					- **I’m more grateful** — I grew up in a place with great infrastructure, resources, education, rules, and government efficiency. It was normal to me. When I came to Spain, I saw how inefficient things were, which made me appreciate The Netherlands way more.
					- **I met someone** — I came to Spain single and met an ex-pat girl who I’m dating now. If I didn’t go to Spain we wouldn’t meet.
					- **I have more material** — I always need new input as a writer and life-long learner. Well, I got a lot of input from the entire experience.
				-
		- Make your goals flexible. Say stuff like:
			- “I want to earn more this year.” But don’t be too specific. Simply do your best to earn more, but don’t beat yourself up to achieve it.
			- “I’m going to start a side business and whenever I feel like it’s robust, I will do it full-time.” Don’t say things like, “I will be a full-time entrepreneur in 12 months!”
		- **I agree with that 100%. But only for things that are within your control.** SMART
			- You can be specific about how many minutes you will exercise today. But you can’t be specific with everything in life.
			- It’s up to you to determine when you need flexible goals and when you need SMART goals. If you can do that, you will not only achieve your goals, but you will also be happy.

		- My goal is to [spend on the things that directly impact my happiness](https://dariusforoux.com/paradox-of-happiness/) and sense of fulfillment. The latter is important because I think we all have this urge to do something meaningful in our lives.
