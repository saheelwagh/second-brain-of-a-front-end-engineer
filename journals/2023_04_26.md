	- Just one year ago, the forefront of Ethereum’s layer-two (L2) scaling solution scene was the “Big Four” — i.e. Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Starknet
	- As of this year, though, it’s safe to call it the “Big Five” per the arrival of the Polygon zkEVM
	- beyond these
		- Base
			- Coinbase recently [introduced Base](https://bankless.ghost.io/r/cf55c6b8?m=a5741338-902e-4c89-84b5-fbbbcc95fe8f), an optimistic-style L2 rollup that the crypto exchange juggernaut is building on Optimism's OP Stack
			- With 110 million verified users, Coinbase is well-positioned to steward this L2 to success over time, and while there are currently no plans for a BASE token, it remains to be seen if that dynamic will stay the case forever.
		- Fuel
			- developed by Fuel Labs that is designed to leverage the increased bandwidth capacity that’s resulting from the ongoing shift in L1 blockchains [toward modular designs](https://bankless.ghost.io/r/d55354f9?m=a5741338-902e-4c89-84b5-fbbbcc95fe8f).
			- Fuel's technology is built on three central pillars: parallel transaction execution, the Fuel Virtual Machine (FuelVM), and a user-friendly developer experience with Sway. Parallel transaction execution allows for better computation and transactional throughput, the FuelVM reduces wasteful processing and expands the potential design space for developers, while Sway provides a powerful dev experience.
		- Linea
			- t ConsenSys recently launched a public testnet of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), [now renamed to Linea](https://bankless.ghost.io/r/a0c660ce?m=a5741338-902e-4c89-84b5-fbbbcc95fe8f), after previously releasing a private testnet of the new L2 in January 2023.
			- aims to power a new generation of decentralized applications built on Ethereum, and notably the scaling solution will natively integrate with ConsenSys’s widely used MetaMask wallet and Truffle developer toolkit.
		- Scroll
			- The project’s architecture is made up of three main infrastructure components: the Scroll Node, the Roller Network, and the Rollup and Bridge Contracts.
			- By leveraging Scroll's infra, developers will be able to execute native EVM bytecode in an advanced L2 environment while maintaining strong security guarantees from the Ethereum base layer.
		- Taiko
			- Taiko consists of three main parts: its zkEVM system for proof generation, the L2 rollup node for managing the rollup chain, and the protocol on L1 for rollup protocol verification

		- The Awesome Advice I Got From The Book “Someday Is Today”
		- He says, “You were seven minutes late today.” When the woman starts to apologize about it, he says, “No, no ,no, that’s not my point. The point is that **during those seven minutes, I wrote nine good sentences**.”
		- He continues, “The average novel is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 sentences. And *every sentence that I write gets me closer to my goal*. And today, I got nine sentences closer.”
		- The power of minutes
			- We usually think that in order to complete creative, massive life projects and tasks, we need to put into “hours and hours” of focused, dedicated work. Whether it be writing a book or painting a mural, we think, “Oh, I need to add an hour of work to make some progress.”
			- When I know I have something to do, I mostly start at 1:00, 1:30, 2:00, etc. I don’t feel like starting at 1:17 or 2:49: those numbers look unattractive to me. So I wait until the clock hits 1:30 or 3:00. And because of this mindset, some minutes have been dumped to waste for no reason, the minutes that I could have spent doing something useful. Plus, I didn’t even consider it a bad thing.
			- Anyway, the point here is that small minutes can add up to certain results, and they can even dictate who we will become in the future.
			- Alternatively, if I spend only 15–30 mins reading valuable books every day, I’ll be finished reading 15 books in a span of 1 year!
			- That’s the power of minute. You don’t have to commit for hours, just spending minutes daily on valuable activities can traject our lives. At the same time, minutes spent on doing frivolous things can derail you in the course of time.

		- Neuroscientist Dr. Sandra Chapman says our brains can actually become addicted to productivity. “A person might crave the recognition their work gives them, or the salary increases they get,”
		- “The problem is that just like all addictions, over time a person needs more and more to be satisfied and then it starts to work against you.”
		- That means you need to crush an increasingly longer to-do list, just to feel like you’ve earned the right to sleep or hang out with your family. Even if you wouldn’t classify your quest for productivity as an addiction, I think we’ve lost track of what we’re trying to accomplish.
		- Our tendency to choose quick, urgent tasks over important tasks with longer timelines is called “[the urgency effect](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40505-022-00236-0),” and it explains why it’s so tempting to drown in your inbox instead of thinking strategically. Yet, important tasks have the power to transform your business or career. They also demand calm, focus, and flow.
		- Real productivity comes from prioritizing meaningful work — and it’s not a matter of discipline or willpower. As I was writing my upcoming book,[ *Automate Your Busywork*](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Your-Busywork-Achieve-Brain/dp/1119901731), I realized that productivity is 1% brains and 99% fighting biology. Like most people, I like to think I control my own behaviors. I make the decisions around here.
		- The human body is an ever-shifting cocktail of hormones, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals that drive our thoughts and behaviors. To do meaningful work, we need to drop the productivity hacks and befriend our biology. Even better, we can build systems that outsmart our hard-wiring entirely.
		- Here’s how to stop battling three core instincts, and unlock the kind of productivity that will revolutionize your work.

			- Observe the cerebral sabotage
				- **Turn off message notifications. Check. Disable beeps and pings on your devices. Check. I’m sure you know the basics of a distraction-free digital life. Unfortunately, all these small (but necessary) tactics are no match for your wily mind.**
				- Take, for example, the [Zeigarnik effect](https://hbr.org/2020/10/why-your-brain-dwells-on-unfinished-tasks), which is the brain’s desire to resolve cognitive tension. When you add a task to your to-do list, you’re opening a loop that your brain longs to close. It wants that item *done*. Your mind then fuels the urgency effect, prodding you to answer a co-worker’s chat message instead of starting a creative project. Our drive for completion also explains why we can’t resist mysteries and cliff-hanger endings.
				- Then there’s the planning fallacy. If you’ve ever wildly underestimated how long a task will take, you know this phenomenon firsthand. When I was starting my company, Jotform, I rarely gave myself enough time to meet my self-imposed deadlines. I eventually learned I was planning for ideal conditions, not real life, which is inevitably filled with road bumps.
				- Knowing what cerebral sabotage looks like can help us avoid it. Even better? [Automate your distraction-prone tasks](https://aytekintank.com/). Draft and schedule emails and text messages for later, so they don’t derail your focus. Use tools like Calendly and YouCanBook.me to automatically schedule, confirm, and prepare for meetings. Let automation close the loops so they don’t distract you.
			- Understand your emotions
				- Procrastination is the enemy of productivity. You won’t achieve your goals if you can’t get started. Many of us were raised to think procrastination belies a lack of willpower or poor time management. Or worse, it’s a sign of laziness.
				- Psychologists [have learned](https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/life-strategies/time-management/procrastination) it’s actually a cage match between two brain centers: the older, unconscious limbic system, which influences pleasure, and the newer, less evolved prefrontal cortex, where we exercise cognitive control. A winning limbic system always picks procrastination — and a temporary reprieve from unpleasant emotions. When the prefrontal cortex triumphs, your brain will do your bidding.
				- Early in my career, I struggled with procrastination, and I had the same self-defeating thoughts you’ve probably experienced, too. Over time, I started asking myself why I was avoiding a certain task. Was I feeling fear? A lack of confidence? Boredom or frustration? Once I could identify and label the emotions without judgment, I could work with my mind, instead of against it.
				- As Jotform grew, I began automating the tasks I wanted to avoid. After all, computers don’t get grumpy or frustrated or overstimulated. Turning repetitive processes into automated workflows took my emotions out of the picture entirely. You can do the same. Let artificial intelligence (AI) and automation tools handle your busywork, like invoicing, submitting expense reports, transcribing meeting notes, and organizing spreadsheet data.
			- care for ur mind and body
				- Our bodies are designed to [conserve energy](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-feb-9-2021-1.5906730/humans-have-not-evolved-to-exercise-says-harvard-prof-1.5907580). Even 100 years ago, we needed every calorie we could consume. Now, if you rarely lift more than a fork, or you haven’t seen a vegetable in days, you can’t do your best work.
				- Studies show that [regular exercise](https://hbr.org/2014/10/regular-exercise-is-part-of-your-job) can improve concentration, memory, creativity, reaction times, and mental stamina. It can also lower stress and help you learn faster. When I start my day with a workout and a hot cup of coffee, I feel unstoppable.
				- Knowing your [peak hours](https://www.jotform.com/blog/productivity-with-waking-up/) is another productivity advantage. These are the times of day when you’re most alert and creative. Difficult tasks elicit less mental pushback and you’re probably in a good mood. Protect these precious hours by automating tedious workflows, and free yourself to focus on the projects that matter.
				- The more you can align your body and mind, instead of wrestling them into productive submission, the more ease and freedom you’ll find in your work. Set reasonable goals and tackle only a few, essential items on your daily to-do list. Give those tasks your very best, and automate the rest.
