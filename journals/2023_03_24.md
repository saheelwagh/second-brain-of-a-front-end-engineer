  collapsed:: true
	- I expected it to "think" rather than "do."
	- At a high level, ChatGPT is horrible at coming up with things "from scratch."
		- • "Write me a Twitter thread on X"
		  • "Draft an email about Y"
		  • "Come up with ideas about Z"
	- So rather than give vague instructions, I learned to give 3 clear constraints in every prompt:
		- ****A specific objective (with input)**
		  **• A specific format for the output**
		  **• A specific list of things to avoid****
	- I use ChatGPT for 3 types of tasks:
		- 1. Executing templates (that I create)
		- 2. Enhancing something already written
		- 3. Synthesizing unstructured notes into a desired output
	- First, I have a ChatGPT prompt template for idea generation.
		- This one took me quite a bit of time to train, but now I can write (and learn) about *anything*
		- All I feed it is a topic I want to explore.
		  collapsed:: true
			- collapsed:: true
			  1. It generates a list of "actions" that someone interested in that topic might have questions about.
			  2. From this list of subtopics, I then have it ask me 3 "questions" about that subtopic.

		- You could see how each of these subtopics is a "pillar" piece of content helping a reader achieve the desired result.
		  collapsed:: true
			- And you build that "pillar" piece from the ground up by answering the questions.
			- Then, you can repurpose each part of the pillar piece into short-form content.
		- chatgpt for rewriting and remixing
			- 1) I ask ChatGPT to rewrite my writing with 6 different "tones":
				- 1. More formal
				  2. More serious
				  3. More sarcastic
				  4. More optimistic
				  5. More pessimistic
				  6. More lighthearted

				  3. George R.R. Martin
				  4. Winston Churchill

				- 1. More concise
				  2. More emphatic
				  3. More humorous

				  3. For college students
				  4. For busy 40-year-old moms
				  5. For an 80-year-old who reads slowly

  collapsed:: true
	- Lots of designers get too caught up in the visuals. It’s important to remember that the page is for highlighting a product/service, and should be treated as such.
	- Start with Content.
	- Start a doc and write out your UVP, user pain points, explanations, etc.
	- Some general copy rules we like to follow:
		- Highlight user benefits
		- Avoid passive voice
		- Keep it concise
	- decide content order
	- decide contant format -> cards, icons, links, buttons
	- style -> best if brand guide;omes exist

	- Fred Brooks, in his essay *[No Silver Bullet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)* identified a three-part plan for finding great software designers:
		- Systematically identify top designers as early as possible.
		- Assign a career mentor to be responsible for the development of the prospect and carefully keep a career file.
		- Provide opportunities for growing designers to interact and stimulate each other.
