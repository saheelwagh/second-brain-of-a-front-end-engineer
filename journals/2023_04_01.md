		  collapsed:: true
			- The [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/deposit?ref=bankless.ghost.io) is the native bridge for sending Ethereum-based assets to and from Polygon PoS. If you want to move funds to Polygon for the first time, this is a simple and solid place to start, but keep in mind that it can take up to 3 hours for withdrawn funds to become available on Ethereum again.
			- For more rapid bridging experiences, there are a range of third-party “fast withdrawal” cross-chain swap bridges you can also consider. [Bungee](https://bungee.exchange/?ref=bankless.ghost.io), [cBridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/1/137/USDC?ref=bankless.ghost.io), and [Hop](https://app.hop.exchange/?ref=bankless.ghost.io#/send?token=ETH) are all options here, though note that every bridge will support different assets — some may support only stablecoin transfers, while others also support MATIC.

		- ZK rollups
			- The Polygon scaling suite is just beginning with regard to all its ZK rollups projects in development, but Polygon PoS is already a dominant force to be reckoned with and is enjoying considerable activity in the Ethereum scaling scene. Plus the Polygon team has additional resources in the works, like [Supernets](https://www.polygon.technology/polygon-supernets?ref=bankless.ghost.io) for appchains and [Polygon ID](https://www.polygon.technology/polygon-id?ref=bankless.ghost.io) for self-sovereign identity, that are poised to become popular tools in their own right.

	- [bitcoin during finanical crisis](https://www.bankless.com/bitcoin-is-dominating)
	  collapsed:: true
		- In the past, there was little escape from this system. Maybe you’d buy some gold and try to bury it in your backyard. Thankfully, we now have a much easier exit in the form of crypto. Cryptoassets have soared since the Banking Crisis of 2023 began, led by a resurgent Bitcoin.
		- **In fact, this rally has the potential to change the perception of crypto forever.** How so? Let’s find out by exploring how markets have responded since the collapse of SVB so we can assess just how it has, and will, impact the future of Bitcoin.
		- Bonds
			- The yield on 2-Year Treasuries has dropped like a stone from 5.1% on March 9 to 4.1% on March 21. The 2-Year is considered by many to “lead the Fed” in that it’s the best predictor of how Central Banks will alter the Fed Funds rate in the short-term. 10-Year Treasuries have also plummeted since SVB, dropping from 4.0% to 3.6% since November 9.
			- This drop in yields is likely due to several factors. One is due to a “flight-to-safety,” as investors flee to bonds due to their (perceived) low-risk, as it's unlikely that the U.S. Government (at least nominally) will default on its debt. The move is likely also being driven by investors front-running a potential Fed pause or pivot, though as we found out today, the hikes haven't quite come to an end.
		- Precious metals have (by their standards) screamed since the onset of the banking crisis. Gold has rallied 11.5% since March 9, while Silver has gained 7.0% as well during this period.
			- Like with Treasuries (and to an extent FAAMG tech stocks), the rally in gold is likely due to a flight-to-safety. Unlike bonds and stocks, Gold and precious metals serve as hedges against an imploding fiat system, as they are non-sovereign, and not dependent on or issued by any one country or monetary regime.
		- Now, onto the main attraction – crypto markets have ripped higher since the onset of the banking crisis. BTC has soared 29.4% and ETH 16.4% since March 9, with the crypto market adding $263B in value over this stretch.
			- This comes despite a 10.1% and 10.6% decline in BTC and ETH respectively between March 9-10 amid the “stablecoin panic,” when USDC and others with exposure to it such as DAI and FRAX, de-pegged upon fears that Circle had lost the $3.3B in deposits it held at SVB.
			- Furthermore, BTC is a liquidity bloodhound - and the asset appears to be sniffing out the substantial increase in the Fed’s balance sheet, and implicit devaluation of the dollar, that has occurred in the wake of SVB.
			- Why the game has changed for btc
				- The game has changed for Bitcoin. Despite being considered by skeptics as the ultimate risk-on asset, BTC has instead acted as a safe haven during the largest bank panic in decades. In fact, it’s done so while outperforming every single major asset class since the onset of the crisis.
				- While the banks burned, Bitcoin has soared and served as the best protection against a broken fiat system.
				- Whatever timeline proves correct, the monetary system is breaking down -- it’s a zombie that never recovered from the global financial crisis and continues to be propped up by printing.
			- With each emergency action, bailout, and dollar printed, its fragility becomes more apparent to the entire world. It feels as if fiat is on the ropes, and all roads lead to endless money printing. Yet, the cynic in me feels that Central Banks are not completely out of ways to change the narrative and continue kicking the can down the road in the interim to prolong their inevitable demise.
			- One area in which I do agree with Balaji is the rapid pace at which hyperinflation will occur, whenever that time comes. Balaji has argued that due to the world’s digitization and the speed at which we can transmit information and value, the collapse of USD relative to Bitcoin will occur at an incredibly fast rate. This makes sense. As we’ve seen in both crypto and now TradFi over the years, in the internet age, people can lose confidence in a currency and financial institution at an incredibly fast rate.
			- It’s quite possible that this hyperinflation narrative is overblown in the interim. But, after the events of the past several weeks, I feel more confident than ever that crypto will grow to represent a more critical flight-to-safety asset for investors.

	- [starknet](https://www.bankless.com/the-bankless-guide-to-starknet)
		- Starknet is a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution for the Ethereum network created by the [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/starknet/?ref=bankless.ghost.io) team.
		- A [ZK rollup](https://www.bankless.com/whats-new-with-zks?ref=bankless.ghost.io) implementation, Starknet exists to address the scalability challenges of Ethereum by enabling drastically faster and drastically cheaper transactions compared to the L1 mainnet. The L2 accomplishes these optimizations all while maintaining its own security and decentralization by being layered atop the Ethereum blockchain.
			- ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nQ81GzTFqtPucPggdISg9Ju0Ql0XcWGZAKBUB0MhN5lwjkA0PFwU3NfoKq79Ragd8H-8BBC5cCX-A1DD3SG0NQ3CLlXdVCt8_b0_sIKa9fNNcdVSbLk4f2uAanNkpxXeQ9lQI6Bou7GvgIz1NTM1ciU)
		- In specifically building on zero-knowledge STARKs, a special class of cryptographic proofs, Starknet aims to solve the [Blockchain Trilemma](https://www.bankless.com/ultra-scalable-ethereum?ref=bankless.ghost.io) with a system that is decentralized, scalable, and secure. Additionally, in being designed for general-purpose applications and with further optimizations to come, Starknet is positioned to play an increasingly useful role in the Ethereum ecosystem in the years ahead
		- Starknet functions as an external execution environment for Ethereum transactions. It aggregates numerous transactions offchain, i.e. outside of Ethereum, and **subsequently posts these condensed batches to Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs to guarantee validity.**
		- This efficient batching approach enables remarkably low-cost transactions. Additionally, **since fees are spread out among all users, Starknet becomes that much more affordable as more people use it.**
		- Besides being a ZK rollup, Starknet has other foundational pillars like its native Cairo programming language. Since Starknet isn’t directly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), smart contracts written for the L2’s execution environment, the Starknet OS, must be written in Cairo instead of Solidity.
		- However, there are groups currently working on bringing EVM support to Starknet like Nethermind, which has a team developing a Solidity-to-Cairo transpiler named Warp. This extension will transform Starknet into what Vitalik Buterin calls a [Type 4 zkEVM](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html?ref=bankless.ghost.io), i.e. a ZK rollup compatible with the EVM that will have better direct compatibility with a range of Ethereum smart contracts.
		- Zooming out, Starknet is already a live L2 but its “[Universe](https://medium.com/starkware/on-the-road-to-starknet-a-permissionless-stark-powered-l2-zk-rollup-83be53640880?ref=bankless.ghost.io)” roadmap will see the scaling solution reach its final form and full decentralization within a matter of years. Until then, the L2 already demonstrates significant efficiency; for example, data from [L2Fees.info](https://l2fees.info/?ref=bankless.ghost.io) shows that token swaps on Starknet are currently significantly less expensive than those on Ethereum.
		- [StarkGate](https://starkgate.starknet.io/?ref=bankless.ghost.io) is the official Ethereum-to-Starknet bridge. You connect your Ethereum and Starknet wallets, select which direction you want to go (to or from Starknet), input your desired deposit amount, and then complete the prompted transaction. Withdrawals work the same way, just in reverse. Keep in mind that this is an alpha version of the bridge, so it can take a while for your deposits to appear.
		- Reminiscent of Minecraft, briq is an NFT crafting and construction system on Starknet that revolves around its foundational building components, which are simply called briqs. These briq NFTs can be assembled, disassembled, and reassembled in various ways, so users can enjoy flexibility in how they customize their creations. The project’s currently in alpha, so expect there to be some bugs along the way.
