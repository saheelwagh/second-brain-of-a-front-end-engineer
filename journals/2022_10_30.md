			- key not to ovethink
			- f starting with a smaller application, you might organically organize your code as you go in a way that works for you.
			- However, since the React Documentation mentions these two organization strategies, let’s take a look at each to see how they are structured. Say we have an e-commerce application that has a user, a list of products, a detailed product page, a shopping cart, and a checkout flow.
				- by feat

					- The root directory here is the  `src`  directory, which is one of the two base directories in your React application (the public folder being the other). In the  `src`  directory, we’ll have the basic  `App.js`  and  `index.js`  files in the root of the folder. Then, we’ll have nested directories for each of the features in your application.
					- src/
					  App.js
					  App.css
					  App.test.js
					  index.js
					  global/ ⇐ items that are in common with entire application
					    AppContext.js
					    ThemeContext.js
					    UserContext.js
					    Button.js
					  cards/
					    index.js
					    Cards.css
					    Cards.js
					    Card.css
					    Card.js
					    Card.test.js
					  detailed-product/
					      DetailedProduct.css
					    DetailedProduct.js
					    DetailedProduct.test.js
					  checkout/
					    ReviewOrder.css
					    ReviewOrder.js
					    ReviewOrder.test.js
					    ShoppingCart.css
					    ShoppingCart.js
					    ShoppingCart.test.js  
					  user/
					    index.js
					    User.css
					    User.js
					    User.test.js
				- by file type
					- As before, we will keep the  `App.js`  and  `index.js`  files in the root of this directory and then have directories representing the constituent parts of the application: components, context, CSS, hooks, and tests.
					- src/
					  App.js
					  index.js
					  components/
					    App.css
					    Card.js
					    Cards.js
					    ConfirmationPage.js
					    DetailedProduct.js
					    Footer.js
					    Navbar.js
					    ReviewOrder.js
					    Settings.js
					    ShoppingCart.js
					    User.js
					  context/ 
					    AppContext.js
					    ThemeContext.js
					    UserContext.js
					  css/
					    Card.css
					    Cards.css
					    ConfirmationPage.css
					    DetailedProduct.css
					    Footer.css
					    Navbar.css
					    ReviewOrder.css
					    Settings.css
					    ShoppingCart.css
					    User.css
					  hooks/
					    useAuth.js
					    useAxios.js
					    ...other custom hooks
					  tests/
					    App.test.js
					    Card.test.js
					    Cards.test.js
					    ConfirmationPage.test.js
					    DetailedProduct.test.js
					    Footer.test.js
					    Navbar.test.js
					    ReviewOrder.test.js
					    Settings.test.js
					    ShoppingCart.test.js
					    User.test.js

		- components and sep of concerns
		  collapsed:: true
			- Prior to React Hooks, it was fairly easy to spot what was considered to be a Stateful Class Component vs. a Presentational Functional Component. Some developers have also referred to them as “smart” components vs. “dumb” components. The smart components, of course, are the ones that carry the state and handle logic, and the dumb components are the ones that purely accept props given to them.
			- Ultimately, it’s up to you and/or your team how to construct your design pattern, but best practice tends to **keep logic and local stateful components separate** from static components.
		- handling state and props
			- While the code would certainly work if you were to pass props down many generations, it’s prone to bugs, and the flow of data can be hard to follow. It’s best if you need to give children access to the state several generations down. You should create some sort of **design pattern for global state management** with Redux or Context API (with Context API currently the simpler, more preferred way).
		- abstraction
		- naming
			- **Components should be PascalCase** — capitalized in camelCase as well and **named for their function** and not the specific application feature

		- decide on ur proj

		- choose lang and tools
		- **list all features and entities**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Once you have a full list of features, split them into **essential** and **nonessential** features to help prioritize. Once we implement all the essential features, we’ll have a program skeleton that we can add to.
			- Now, list out all the entities that’ll be involved in your program. A good way to do this is to look at your features and ask what entities must interact to make it happen. If you repeat this for every function, you’ll have found all the entities involved in your program.

		- map the project architecture
		  collapsed:: true
			- Now we’re going to make a flowchart of our final project. I recommend doing this with sticky notes or digitally so you can move the pieces around. Put each feature into a box and post it on the same board.
			- Then go through each feature and connect it to the relevant features with a line. These can be features that work in tandem or features that occur at different times in the program. In other words, *how will the user progress through your different program features?*
			- Make sure to mark any point in the program where you have branching paths. These will become decision points in your program. Also, write which entities are involved in each feature within the feature box. This flowchart will act as a **blueprint** for your program’s structure.
			- Once you have your flowchart, write different types of inputs that a user might do in different colored boxes. Trace each input through the program and see which points it touches as it progresses through the program. Document these. If you find an unsupported input, create the features needed to handle it.
