[[Turning Pro]]

I have never called myself a blogger. 
When people ask me what I do,
Sometimes I say I'm a web developer. Some times I say I'm a web designer. If someone asked me the question across a week, they would hear both. If they know the difference, they would call me incoherent, not truthful even.

But I am fully aware of what I'm saying.  My answer depends on the task occupying the most of my attention in that moment. And the way my brain works, once I enter a "mode", I forget my other roles : as a worker, son, brother.

I, however, lie by exclusion. I never mention the activity I do daily. The activity that gets me out of bed every morning, away from the demons of past trauma that want to keep me tucked in. The activity that makes me feel the closest to my true self : writing. 

I cannot recollect a single instance when I have referred to myself as a writer. Half, because I have great examples within my family to compare myself against even before I move on to comparing outside. My late uncle was an accomplished writer. One of my cousins is following in his footsteps, on a more academic path.

And half because I had another self identity : blogger. 
A blogger is just a component of being a writer. Just one place to showcase his words. A writer is more than that. He sjares his word, his art in all walks of life. In his convesations, his ... , .... etc. So far, I have only reliably translated this voice in one superflous place : instagram captions. 

That blog moved houses often.
It started on medium
Then it was self hosted because the egoist programmer in me thought I could configure it to my liking and hosting on readymade solutions was beneath me.
Then the egoist programmer found out there are more urgent tasks than tweaking a site that does not pay you. 
So it moved to a new place : hashnode, where it lived until last week. 
On Monday, 16th January, as soon as I woke up, I checked off a long standing entry from my to-do list : I killed my blog. 

I recently bought [[Turning Pro]] by [[Steven Pressfield]] and finished reading it in one sitting across 90 minutes. 
The younger me would have been disappointed to have spent 400 rs on something so short. My current self knows the value of a book's words does not lie in its quanitity but quality.
It is not about how long you took to read a book but how long it continues to affect you. Reading isn't about how many books you have read but how many have had an impact on your life. This has had one of the biggest impacts.

In this book and its prequel, [[war of art]] , Steven describes 2 phases of a creative's life : 
Amateuer : living in denial of you calling. Fear themed. Settled on the easy way out through distractions and addiction. Being scared of the resistance in brain. 

Pro : The oppsoite. Turniung around and facing the fears.

In those 90 minutes I realised I had been living as an amature. 
I knew it vaguely from before, I just did not have the proper way to label it. 
The versions I had come across prior, such as the saying :
"All people are born twice. the second afdtejr he...."

This book, with its real life stories and raw words, resonated with me. For 90 minutes I was reading it with laser focus, something that eludes me virtually every time I read it. Simulateously I was getting flashbacks of my own life. 2022 marked the end of a difficult decade in my life. The pain from then masks any memories associated. This when I try to visualise that past, evertyhing appears fuzzy. I am only able to reliably recall the memories until I passed out of high school and then from the time I finally found my footing in college after 3 years of drifting. Everything else in between is a hazy film.

But in those 90 minutes the haze cleared out. I was able to live through every chapter of that decade. And this time, I was not judging myself. I was only observing, noting. I could recollelct everythiong that had gone wrong that was not in my control. And everything that I did wrong which was under mine. Unlike before I did not experience any panic, grief or resentment. As I finally knew what to do next. I have spent the last few years collecting solutions with only a vague picture of my problems. Now, I had the perfect match of both.
Now, I felt ready to live like a pro.

That was last week. At the end of which I had a gala time at my cousin's wedding. It's very rare for me to completely forget about pending work and take a proper break. This was one such, not by choice, but due to the abundance of people, love, festivities, and, with me having taken off restraints for the first time ever, booze.

When I resumed work upon return, I was hungover. Not from the booze, it was a minscule amount compared to the average, but with happiness. Thus I continued to drift in my amateuer mode. Getting pulled around by distractions, getting some work done for the sake of it but not diving into depth. Thus, not producing anything of value. Until the news of a friend's accident reminded me of the finiteness and fragility of life. 
I spent the rest of the day in deep thinking. Less about the fried's health, and more about what I should do in the finite time that a person gets (for the record, my friend would probably approve of this priority of thinking). Until the thinking tired me into sleep.

I woke up today and checked off a long pending task from my to-do list. 
(my to-do list was not this extreme, fortunately.)

I murdered a darling. 
I deleted my blog.

Those half-assed posts, those handful of reacts and comments, served my previous phase as an escape hatch from mediocrity. I could deflect the conversation from what I had accomplished in m line of work (spoiler alert: hardly anything) and point out to this 'hobby' of blogging. But there is no free lunch. It came with the drawback that whatever I wrote, somehow got polarised towards my exisiting style of writing. It did not feel natural. It felt rushed. There was a bit of Saheel Wagh in every article that was trapped within filler words. So I got rid of this filler hub from my life.

Turning Pro is a book about habits, as the author claims bang in the middle of it. Despite that, it only pays lip service to habit formation, only going as far as mentioning that habits are repetitive, boring, and necessary.

The most eye opening insight on habits was in the book atomic habits. Identity based habit change. Once you form an identity, you develop the habits that develop around it. The reverse does not work. 

I deleted my old identity and adopting a new one. I am now a devotee of the creative pursuit. My blog has ceased to exist as 'Swagh's blog' where any random musing could go.
It is now a place where I share savage tips on surviving as a creative. Tips that I needed when I was at my lowest. It is now, sawagh.blog.

The people around you will resist, criticise changes you instill in yourself. To make matters worse, these voices will be loudest when you hit a plateau and no results are in sight. 
You can't muder them.
Neither can you murder your inner voice that attempts to persuade you into self sabotage.
But you can muder evertyhing else. You can murder all the sources of your amateuer ways. Those routines that are dear to you but slowly chip away your potential. You too, can muder those darlings. You only need the conviction that you are meant for something bigger.
