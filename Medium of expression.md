Creativity has a medium of expression. Outlets through which  it manifests itself.  

Friends part

As for me, I dont have other talents such as dance, singing  or acting. Feedback of not knowing what is going behind my face. 

What I have is a way around words. Although I do not consider myself a writer yet, I find it easy to break apart and combine words in a way that at best captivates people and at a minimum clears swiriling doubts from my head. 

Diving into writing, the act can be public or private. Private writing is for my own clarity. Journal pages and scribbles. 
I cannot function without these. 
Fortunately I am not at __ was killed phase.. yet.


This has forms of expression

On top form -> content pieces. Books, movie, video scripts theatre scripts. The stuff of elites. Educational or enterainting

In a medium  level , a passable article like this or a good caption or a tweet. passive consumption

At the lowest level, text conversations.


But the worst form of epxression is when it manifests into something physical. Many of us have experienced this dark energy of feeling stuck in a rut. Slowly you start hating surruindign activitews that prevent you from writing dancing or singing. 


IMO when starting out you have to ensure two things
1. It should be your first major daily activty
2. It should not be your first source of money or prestige. 


Explainer on second point -> need space to develop your voice without attaching too much to outside validation. 

first part
There are some things a part of your identity. Writer, exploer, smoker. We are addicted to it. We gte withdrawal syndrome if we do not do it. This then seeps into the rest of the day and rest of the acvtivbitire.s

You might be focused on work but subconcoius will know ur not supposed to be doing this.

But then what enriches your soul does not feed your stomach  (yet). SO what do we do ? compress the activity to a minimum time block. start with 25 minutes and stretch till 90 if feasible for you. this is backed by evidence. 

Join my group to test this assumption over 7 days. 

this is not stunt to get no, ur someone I want to read this.
