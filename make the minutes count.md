- started with deep work
- used pomodoro
- noticed mental slacking off 
- may be adhd ?
- focused only when there is an elusive connect between what i love and challenge
- lately been scaling down and owning up to responsibilities
- clearing of mental loops helps

Who is the prime minister / chief of armed staff of Sri lanka -> peak war of LITTE. There was a pin drop silence in the class. I answered -> Sharath Fonseca. Teacher made everyone clap for me. Everything felt so effortless.

Then it stopped.
Year by year I began slipping up until I hit my lowest in 2013. 
Then I picked myself up and fought back. Hit another low in 2016. Slowly the decade got filled with most lows punctured by few highs. 

In all those ups and downs there was a recurring theme. I saw that i sufffered from slacking so I compensated by being harsh on myself
Deiscoverd deep work
Kept adding stuff. 
After all, if I failed by wasting a few hours, I'd surely succedd by using thise hours ? heck, why not add even more and become the most successful ?

So i kept planning around hours but nothing worked, EWnded up hating myself. 
Only focused when in expectation of something enjoyable. Like playtime.
Sun and moon size to distance ratio
Weekend plans -> big enough for the pull. 

So now I start small and stop when I stop enoying.

I dont aim for the maximum but the minimum.
