My journey into blockchain started in 2019 with iHack but I gave up because there weren't enough learning resources. It felt like you had to have some existing business connections to know what area to target. I resumed my interest in 2021 after participating in Ineuron's hackathon. While preparing for it I realized the blockchain (now web3) ecosystem had matured a lot and now there are tons of resources available. And I am learning it ever since, using learnweb3DAO as my primary resource. And participated in a couple of more hackathons including ethIndia where I got to witness just how strong India's web3 community is. 
Still, something felt amiss. Now I could learn nearly all technical parts of web3 development (probably in an even more democratized manner than web2) without hassle. But still, it felt like you had to have some existing knowledge of where to apply all these concepts to make rapid progress. (Might be a side effect of me being away from all communities for a long time). I want to give web3 development a proper shot using the guidance that the fellowship would provide. 
I want to leverage the knowledge gained through this fellowship to create a strong web3 developer community in Goa.
