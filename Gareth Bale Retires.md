We had installed satellite tv after tears of resisiting. That meant I could finally watch epl. Up until that point football was only limited to internationals for me. I was too young in 2002 when Mum and I  transpired/conspired to watch Captain Sindabad movie instead of England argentina classic. But old enough to be fascinated by the heroics of Oliver Kahn who single handedly carried Germany to the finals. Somewhere it inspired me to become   a goalkeeper. A dream that was cut short fitst by my school having no football team in my days amd then puberty deciding against blessing me wih further height. 

In the years following, I lacked any footballing hero although I loved the game. There was the fascination with the Dutch team due to the flamboyance in their play, in their famed oranje shirts, and the beautiful dutch female fans donning them in the stands.  There was also the desspise against the dirty defensive Italians and the manner in whci hthey had won the 206 wc. Reason why I wildly celebrated their loss against slovaika in 2010 that knocked them out in the group stage. 

But regular watching of football only began when we got satellite tv for the fist time. I knew Manchested United and liverpool like every other football watcher. Even had a pool jersey I had won in a chess trournament. My dad liked the intricate play of Man city assembled expensively and also liked the same in arsenal which i shared without knowing what was to come in future. 

But i did not get attached to any of those teams. I was resigned to the fact that eventually I would start supporting a team based on my favourite color, red. But it was one man in Lillywhite that changed that.


I am a firm non-beliver of love at first sight. For me such obessions and infatuations make you ignore the toxic traits that lay underneath anyone's shining side. Instead I take my own sweet time, not allowing any shining lights to awe me. 
By that time I will have subconiusly made peace with those toxicities or at least with the time that its going to fix it. By the time I have fallen in love, I willl have lost count whether it's the 50th sight or 500th. 

Whenever the ball fell at the feet of the # 11 of tottenham, you could sense something is about to happen. He would knock the ball beyond the covering defender. And seemingly, beyond himself too. Kind of like us before we learnt to dribble. Just oush the ball ahead and chase it. More often than not, losing it. But with him it was different. By the time the opponent knew what was happening, he would have the ball in his stride again. He would repeat the same with the next defender, get to the byline and cross it in the path of an onrushing Jeramine Defoe, who also seemed to be cursed by puberty and as a result missed a lot of crosses. 
Or in those magical plays that would make anyone fall in love, he would cut inside, create a gap wide enough for just the ball to pass and shoot. The shots had so much venom, the ball would land inside the net before the goalkeeeper extended his arms fully.

Gareth Bale had scored again!. And I had fallen in love. With the sport. As {ferguson} famously said, football, bloody hell!

Youve heard often that first love never dies. I would say it lives on because it's a mystery. What made you fall in love is what you first seeked as a person. And if your answer to that is nothing but someone's body, I feel sorry for your primal brain. Or you were lucky enough to have every other need solved in your life.

Gareth bale made you fall in love with football because he showed what a human body could achieve on the field in peak condition.

No alien footwork of messi. No dazzling step overs of ronaldo. Just push the ball and run. Beat your opponent by simply being better, fitter. Live life on easy mode. Something even a 16 year old in India could try on  mudded ground. (albeit against a bunch of 12 year olds who were natually no match for his speed back then)

### The exit
The summer of 2013 was the worst in my life. Not just because Bale left for real madrid on a then world record fee. But because I suffered the first major setback of my life.

A lot of what was familiar to me, gave me comfort passed by me. Friends, activities, Gareth bale (who transferred).
And I did not chase any of it. I retreated to my own shell, trying to grasp what had come over. I did not have time for the activities, or to watch Bale at his new wretched club famed for economic malpractices.

But I stuck by a few essenitals. A few closest friends, activities that I wish I HAD pursued more vigorurously, like quizzing, writing and coding. And to tottenham. As I bounced back from my own failures, as did Tottenham. Now champions league regulars.
But we haven't won anything. WHILE BALE did, 22 trophies. Sometimes you need to let go of the old to try new challenges. And after a decade of trying, I finally feel ready to embrace new mindsets. new ways of working. And commit, at least to some exciting job and probably even to some even more exciting person. 

Like bale I share the attitude of not giving a fuck. Like him playing golf (insert slogan answer) instead of settling for backup role at madrid. Unfortuantely I dont earn as much money to go play golf,.
Any career i choose, by the looks of it looks  to be many, will have abrupt stops like his early retirement. For me, everything is an expt and there'll be a lot of it this decade.

Until then, time to put down my head and do the work.
Thinking. Writing. Coding. In that order.
