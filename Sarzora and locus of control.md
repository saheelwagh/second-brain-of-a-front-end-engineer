Sarzora was a place I had in mind to visit for a long time. For some reasosn it appealed to me a lot. To the extent that I used to imagine  takimg my college time crushes there on a date. It seemed mystical in images. Every time I made plans it never worked out. 
At talk was getting bored. Had 2 choices
{insert maps pic}. Go to beach belt or go to sarzora. 
Went with the sarzora option. Saw a kid sitting on the bike. Wondered why parents givr bikes to children.
With grand plans to sit there and write for hours. Only to see that the gate was locked (try to find pic from net of closed gate or ->)
here's a pic I clicked by sneaking my hand in to make it look like I got in.
So was dejected and leaving back.  The kid from before got up from his bike and started saying something in my direction. After getting over initial guess that he was laughing on me, I realised he was whispering my name. 
I stopped my bike and that is when I was transported back from maps and desires into the presen.t That was my former classmate from gec. 
I had forgotten him but he recognised me through the helmet. Local . Showed me a hidden path into the reservoir. 
I had still not remembered his name so I kept making small talk about gec. He showed me around. I clicked some amazing pics and he clicked my pic and I smiled for once because I was actually happy. 
We exhanged numbers and the truecaller popup finally displayed his name : kunal.

So I was wondering how did this guy recognise me while I did not. Recalled that we were among the group that had struggled together. I remembered how a faculty had made him cry over a file and we were the only people there to console him. Struggling together forms a bond stronger than all else. I had gone to sarzora to escape humanity (how the fake conversations at conf were getting to my head) and returned learning the importance of friendship and human bonds. 

I had given up the need to control my experiences but it ended up being one of the most memorable days of my life.
