		- If you are writing a stock trading, banking or a Finance-based app or you need to store a lot of relationships, for instance, when writing a social networking app like Facebook, then you should pick a relational database. Here’s why:
			- Transactions & Data Consistency
			  If you are writing software which has anything to do with money or numbers, that makes transactions, ACID, data consistency super important to you. Relational DBs shine when it comes to transactions & data consistency. They comply with the ACID rule, have been around for ages & are battle-tested.
			- Storing Relationships
			  If your data has a lot of relationships like which friends of yours live in a particular city? Which of your friend already ate at the restaurant you plan to visit today? etc. There is nothing better than a relational database for storing this kind of data.
				- Relational databases are built to store relationships. They have been tried & tested & are used by big guns in the industry like Facebook as the main user-facing database.

			- Handling A Large Number Of Read Write Operations
			  Look towards NoSQL databases when you need to scale fast. For example, when there are a large number of read-write operations on your website and when dealing with a large amount of data, NoSQL databases fit best in these scenarios.
				- Since they have the ability to add nodes on the fly, they can handle more concurrent traffic and large amounts of data with minimal latency.
			- Running data analytics
			  NoSQL databases also fit best for data analytics use cases, where we have to deal with an influx of massive amounts of data.

		- how arch helkps in dev
			- We’ve had a few clients who’ve wanted to migrate their legacy application to a new frontend like Reactjs. Upon interacting with them, we figured out that a few of them didn’t know what an application architecture is. And even if they knew about it, they didn’t care about asking their agency or developer about it.
			- Here’s the thing: like most things in life, taking time to plan ahead and invest in a scalable architecture can help in the longer run, especially when your web application is going to serve a large number of users. This is when understanding some of the architectural considerations and tradeoffs behind building big websites can result in smarter business decisions. If you’re determined to invest in a scalable react architecture for your website, Simform’s custom web app development offering is for you.
		- what exactly is react architecture ? how it helps in web dev ?
			- Unlike other UI libraries and frameworks, Reactjs doesn’t enforce an architecture pattern
			- Just beneath the user interface lies a tree of several React components. In general terms, a react component is nothing but the central structural unit — something minimal, like a button, label, or text input label or perhaps something more complex, like a registration form, user-profile, etc.

			- React already offers an out-of-the-box mechanism called the local state. **However, the mechanism is not sufficient alone to use in real-world applications.** That’s where state management libraries like Redux come into play.

			- How to make it loosely coupled ?

		- redux
			- With Redux, we fetch data once and store it in the Redux store that can be used as a Single Source of Truth. This means it is now all ready to be used anytime by any component.
			- Now, let’s assume that <Doctor> is our outermost container component that is near the Redux store. So every time any component needs data, it’s the <Doctor> components that will serve as the single source of truth and help them with data.
			- But… What if some components in the hierarchy don’t need the data at all?
			  collapsed:: true
				- Well, you can plug in the data into any component without affecting the other components by using a library called React-redux.
				- After the data is passed on to other components, the change in the state is passed on to reducers that update the UI.

			- some tips
				- dont overthink. avoid using too deep nested files and folders
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1655369119834_0.png)
				- Divide your features into separate reducers, with each one exporting its own action creators and selectors
				- use saga for async and side effects
