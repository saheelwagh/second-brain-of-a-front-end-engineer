- [52 week savings challenfe](https://juno.finance/blog/what-is-the-52-week-savings-challenge)
	- The 52-Week Savings Challenge is a way to incrementally save money across the period of one year. The challenge helps you to systematically set aside a part of your income or allowance corresponding to each week of the challenge.
	- The 52-Week Money Challenge starts off easy since you begin by saving small amounts. The challenge gets progressively harder with time. Looking at it weekly, the amounts may seem manageable, but you must realize that by week 31 you will be setting aside $100 in a month. It is essential to make sure in advance that your [monthly budget](https://onjuno.com/guides/the-ultimate-guide-to-budgeting) can handle this sort of strain before committing to the challenge.
