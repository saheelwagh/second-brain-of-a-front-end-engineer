		- Now let’s create another prompt. Say we want to extract airport codes from the text “I want to fly from Orlando to Boston”
		  collapsed:: true
			- Here’s the standard prompt that most would use.
			- Extract the airport codes from this text: “I want to fly from Orlando to Boston”
		- This might get the job done, but sometimes it might not be enough. In such cases, you have to use few shot standard prompts.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Extract the airport codes from this text:
			- Text: “I want to fly from Los Angeles to Miami.”
			  Airport codes: LAX, MIA
			- Text: “I want to fly from Nashville to Kansas City.”
			  Airport codes: BNA, MCI
			- Text: “I want to fly from Orlando to Boston”
			  Airport codes:
		- Role prompting
			- Sometimes the default behavior of ChatGPT isn’t enough to get what you want. This is when you need to set a role for ChatGPT.
			  collapsed:: true
				- Say you want to practice for a job interview. By telling ChatGPT to “act as hiring manager” and adding more details to the prompt, you’ll be able to simulate a job interview for any position

				- Just like that, you can turn ChatGPT into a language tutor to practice a foreign language like Spanish or a movie critic to analyze any movie you want. [In this article](https://medium.com/p/f7e7e38b1cee), I dive more into how to turn ChatGPT into your language tutor or language buddy.
				- You only need to start your prompt with the words “Act as a … ” and then add as many details as possible. If you need some inspiration, **check [this repository where you’ll find prompts](https://prompts.chat/)**to make ChatGPT behave like a stand-up comedian, doctor, and more.
				-
			- Add personality to prompts
			  collapsed:: true
				- First, by “adding personality to our prompts” I mean adding a style and descriptors. Adding a style can help our text get a specific tone, formality, domain of the writer, and more.
					- >
					- Write [topic] in the style of an expert in [field] with 10+ years of experience.
					- ==Write a ====**witty**==== 500-blog post on why AI will not replace humans. Write in the style of an expert in artificial intelligence with 10+ years of experience. Explain using ====**funny**==== examples==
				- For example, before generating the post with the previous prompt we could first generate knowledge and only then write the post.
					- >
					- Generate 5 facts about “AI will not replace humans”
				-
			- Chain of thought prompting
			  collapsed:: true
				- Unlike standard prompting, in chain of thought prompting, the model is induced to [produce intermediate reasoning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html) steps before giving the final answer to a problem. In other words, the model will explain its reasoning instead of directly giving the answer to a problem.
				- Why is reasoning important? The explanation of reasoning often leads to [more accurate results](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intermediate/chain_of_thought).
				- we have to provide few-shot examples where the reasoning is explained in the same example. In this way, the reasoning process will also be shown when answering the prompt.
				- Here’s a comparison between standard and chain of thought prompting.
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1094/0*eG_s7bLIYLHcZJ2L.png)
				- Note that chain of thought prompting is [effective](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intermediate/chain_of_thought) in improving results on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

	- Public speaking -> skill that sets you apart as dev
		- >
		- There is something incredibly powerful in speaking to a large group of people about the things you’re either good at, matter to you, and are passionate about.
		- **Software engineering is not coding.** Let me repeat that for the folks in the cheap seats. Software engineering is not coding. In fact, **I’d argue that those who viciously hang on with their teeth to every coding opportunity, while ignoring everything else, will soon fall behind in their careers**, and likely stop at senior level. Nothing inherently wrong with that, as long as that was a conscious choice. Beyond that, however, skills like leadership or public speaking are becoming increasingly sought after, and rewarded.
		- Suppose you have 200 software engineers in a room, and you open the floor up for questions at an all-hands meeting. Far more often than not, it takes a while for someone to dare speak up, and even once the silence is broken, you’ll have maybe 10–15 volunteering their thoughts or asking questions. And that’s on a good day. On a more regular day, it’s probably just 5!
		- here are reasons, very legitimate ones in fact, for not wanting to hone such a skill. Let me outline just a few:
			- **It takes you away from coding.** What? You’re clearly not going to just hop on a stage without any preparation whatsoever and talk for 10–60 minutes. Just from the few that I have done, I can already say, it takes time, preparation, and that’s just as universally true for your first talk and your 50th. You will be coding less, and not everyone is happy with that.
			- **It is stressful. **Regardless of personality, getting on a stage in front of a group of people takes guts. As a software engineer, when it comes to programming, we know that one way or another we’ll solve the problem. Being on stage is live. That adds stress. Remember your most stressful interview and dial that up by 100. Plenty of engineers out there who just want a cushy, relaxed career, with major incidents being the most stressful thing they’ll ever face.
			- **Not wanting to be seen as a ladder-monkey by their peers.** Yup. It happens in engineering too. You decide to stand out and suddenly, there will be a group of engineers who start having a different opinion of you, and not in a good way.
			- **Being terrible at managing time.** The moment you start context switching, especially to something that’s not code-heavy, it becomes a bit of an art to effectively shift focus from one thing to another. I used to bitch and moan about context switching, until I turned it into a skill, but it does take a lot of time.
		- As someone increasingly interested in developing this skill, I can already see **that there are benefits to it both on a personal and professional level**, and maybe this article will nudge you to embark on the same journey as I.
			- **Self-confidence.** Standing up in front of tens or hundreds of people can be quite transformative for your self-confidence. After that first talk, you will walk off the stage a different person. Even in the worst-case scenario, you’ll know this might not be your thing, but at least you will stop wondering and set sail in a different direction.
			- **Visibility.** Many software engineers disregard this, but being visible can often be crucial to one’s career trajectory. Just churning out great code, delivering every story on time, writing great tests typically isn’t enough to progress. Managers regularly have to give a list of reasons for someone to be promoted, especially beyond senior level, but if no one but your manager knows you, the board will find it hard to approve the promotion.
			- **You will pick up other skills on the side**, like a good breathing technique, a good, articulated speaking pace, knowing how to create good, engaging presentations, or even how to use clickers, microphones, and confidence monitors. Yeah, these last ones are pretty great. They’re basically a cheat-sheet that you’re absolutely allowed to use!
			- **You learn how to pass information on to an audience** in a way that you don’t make them fall asleep. The presentation itself is, of course, important, but just reading off what’s behind you on the screen is not enough, in fact, it’s discouraged. You learn how to go beyond and use it only as support for what you’re speaking about.
