- title:: Complete Web Design : from figma to webflow to freelancing
- Steve Jobs @not including floppy disk on imac->wayne gretzky -> skate to where the puck is going
	- bet on tech that is going forward
	- [[what is webflow]]
- limitations of webflow
  collapsed:: true
	- no webapps
	- target ecom only when you gain good enough real work xp with regular and general web design
- demand for webflow
  collapsed:: true
	- majority of demand isn't platform specific
	- cleints edit direcly on the site
- webflow has a learning curve
- Parts of this course

	- secrets of good design
	- design practice
	- webflow
	- client project
	- freelancing tips
	- advanced
- sectrets of good design
	- knowing guidelines and tips
	- design is a mental skill. Not the tool
- it all starts with alignment and grid
  collapsed:: true
	- why align makes looks better -> same as clean room vs messy room -> chaos vs order
	- inexp -> drop randomly alignments
	- ways of align
	  collapsed:: true
		- left -> feels most natu
		- center ->
		- right
		- top <- hori
		- cen
		- bottom
	- the grid
		- reuse values as much as possible -> maintain balance
		- repeat -> predictable -> trust
		- as beginner -> follow and then grow flexibility
		- the center layout -> no grid but there is alignment
		-
- optical illusions
	- sometimes same dimension objects might appear smaller bcz of less weight
	- centred text -> floating ship, not sink -> for lighter obj. for heavier go with opp
	- proximity -> related => close -> navs, btn desc etc

- Part 4 working with client
  collapsed:: true
	- the good design process
	  collapsed:: true
		- usually starts with a para of email
		- in beg -> no process just wing it
			- creative block
			- mismatched tastes -> spent a lot of time designing and then complete rejection
			- lack of content -> usage of dummy
				- client did not come back with optimum content
		- process -> design became linear
		- step 1 -> project bried
		- 2 -> moodboard
			- clients have hard time explaining their taste
			- thus better to grab from other sites and ask what like
		- 3 -> wireframe to accomodate content
		-
	- [[Project Brief]]
		- every proj shd start with 1
		- 2 most imp qs
			- what goal
			- who designed for
		- double check if agree
	- [[Moodboard]]

			- find the frame that tells the story on its own -> peeking through the blinds
		- softcrop
		  collapsed:: true
			- fade and content over that
			- vertical img as bg on wide sccree ? -> add colored soft crop
			- f
	- rule of thirds
	  collapsed:: true
		- intersection of lines -> best placement spot
		- add the off center tension only when needed
		- super handy rule with faces
		- first person perspective -> center might be better
		- objects in the image might offset the intersection
		-
	- unbox it
	  collapsed:: true
		- remove bg
	- Pick photos like a pro
	  collapsed:: true
		- most are lame -> when it is clear as a fake
		- questions to ask when selecting

			- does the set look realistic ?
		- where to  find
			- unsplash
			- pexels

- The art of color
	- sampling colors -> best way to choose is to borrow, not create inside your app

		- hsl
- design tricks every designer should know
	- contrast
		- color
		- small
		- weight -> ex  removing fill
		- f
	-
- part 2  -> practice design by beginning expertrs
	- mimic method
		- guitar -> learn by mimicking son -> ask players
		- so that you have good habits by the time you create your own
		- stage 1 copying -> learning the tiny decisions
		- stage 2 remix -> can practice on real projects
		- synthesis
		  collapsed:: true
			- multiple inspir
			- personal touch so cannot point to one styke
		- the biggest secret of great artists -> inspiration
		  collapsed:: true
			- picasso -> dogon -> cubism

			- use dribble
			- lapa ninja
			- pinterest
				- goo sugeest algo
			- elsewhere such as movie posters

		- collection of inspirations
		- LATER article on moodboard and collections synthesized
		- task : create a moodboard ofr a uber project
			- gather ss
			- search dribble using least keywordsw
			- usually spends an hour
			- search on and off topic
			- keep some avl pics in figma
			- use dark bg for figma frame
			-
	- using the mood board nd other inpirations
