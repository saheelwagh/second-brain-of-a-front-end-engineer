Procrastination refers to delaying an action. 
Self regulation refers to “thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that guide individuals to set personal goals.”

- For those unable to self-regulate, Edwards adds that the time before bed may be the only time to process the emotional backlog from the day, including “frustration and anger, or fear and anxiety they may have felt during the day but shut out.”

Thus for me a shutdown hour  will benefit a lot. 
Kroese’s research indicates that “self-regulation interventions” could be helpful at improving sleeping behavior, and therefore reducing sleep procrastination. Getting adequate sleep requires more than just setting a bedtime (especially considering that self-regulation comes with thoughts and feelings, and not just behaviors).
